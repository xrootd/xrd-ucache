# uCache

xrd-ucache or simply uCache is a transparent, per-user read cache for
remote ROOT/XRootD data. You install it once and point it at the servers
you read from; thereafter every file your jobs read from them is cached
on local disk, so the **second and later** passes over the same data
come from that disk instead of the network. Nothing in your analysis
code changes and the first cold run has minimal overhead, so there's
little to lose in trying it.

## How it works

uCache is a plug-in for the XRootD client — the library ROOT already uses for
every `root://` URL. Before your job opens its first file, that library's
plug-in manager reads the plugin configs in your home directory and asks
whether any of them claims the server in your URL. If `ucache.conf` does, the
manager loads the library it names, and from then on uCache answers that
file's reads: a data block already on your local disk is served from there,
anything else is fetched from the server and kept for next time.

![ROOT hands every root:// URL to the XRootD client library, whose plug-in manager reads ucache.conf from your home directory and loads the uCache plugin; the plugin then serves data blocks from your local disk and fetches the rest from the server.](docs/images/how-it-works.png)

Nothing about your analysis changes — same commands, same file names, same
results; only where the bytes come from. Delete that one config file and the
same job runs exactly as it did before.

An environment variable, `XRD_PLUGIN`, can take the config file's place: the
plug-in manager then loads the library it names for every server. That is the
quickest way to try uCache, below.

## Try it

No administrator needed: everything goes into `~/ucache` in your own account.
You need:

- **x86_64 Linux of the EL9 generation or newer.** Tested on AlmaLinux 9;
  the other EL9 systems (RHEL and Rocky 9, lxplus) are the same platform. The
  binaries need glibc 2.34 or newer, so EL8 and CentOS 7 cannot run them. EL10
  and other distributions that new are likely to work but are not tested.
- **ROOT that already reads `root://` files in your shell** — from lxplus, an
  LCG view, CMSSW or conda. uproot works too, through its XRootD bindings.

```sh
# 0. your ROOT can read root:// (prints "yes")
root-config --has-xrootd

# 1. get it: nothing written outside ~/ucache
mkdir -p ~/ucache
curl -L https://github.com/xrootd/xrd-ucache/releases/latest/download/xrd-ucache-el9-x86_64.tar.gz \
  | tar -xz -C ~/ucache --strip-components=1

# 2. switch it on, in this shell only
export PATH=$HOME/ucache/bin:$PATH
export XRD_PLUGIN=$HOME/ucache/lib64/libXrdClUCache.so
export UCACHE_DIR=/tmp/$USER/ucache        # fine for a try; see below for real use

# 3. check it, then see it work
ucache doctor
root -l -b -q ~/ucache/share/xrd-ucache/ucache_demo.C
```

`doctor` names anything that would stop uCache from caching, and exits
non-zero if there is. `ucache_demo.C` is a small analysis: from 100 files of
public CMS open data (Run2016 SingleMuon) it selects events with two muons of
opposite charge, computes their invariant mass from six muon branches on all
cores, and saves the mass spectrum as `ucache_demo_dimuon.png`. It makes four
passes, each in a fresh ROOT process:

1. **cold, byte cache** — reads the data from the server and keeps a copy of
   it on your local disk (the files are removed from the cache first);
2. **warm, byte cache** — reads the same data from that copy, nothing from the
   server;
3. **cold, replica** — reads from the server again (the copy is removed
   first), converting each file as it arrives into a form that is faster to
   decode, and keeps that instead (recompression);
4. **warm, replica** — reads the converted copy: nothing from the server, and
   less time spent decompressing.

For each pass it reports the event-loop time (ROOT starting up and compiling
are left out: they take the same with or without a cache), how much came from
the server, and whether the result was the same every time. Each cold pass
fetches about 4 GB, and the cache needs about 6 GB of room.

On a Mac mini (Apple M2 Pro), for example, on 2026-09-26:

```
Processing ucache_demo.C...
uCache demo: dimuon mass spectrum of 100 files, 10 threads
  pass 1 of 4: cold, byte cache ...
  pass 2 of 4: warm, byte cache ...
  pass 3 of 4: cold, replica    ...
  pass 4 of 4: warm, replica    ...

  event-loop time (ROOT start-up and compiling not counted):
  1. cold, byte cache   105.0 s     4.16 GB from the server
  2. warm, byte cache    32.6 s     0.00 GB from the server   3.2x faster than 1
  3. cold, replica      105.0 s     4.16 GB from the server   1.0x faster than 1
  4. warm, replica       12.5 s     0.00 GB from the server   8.4x faster than 1
  Same result every time: yes (27012477 muon pairs)
  Mass plot: ucache_demo_dimuon.png
```

The same demo on two machines, both on 2026-09-26, with 4.16 GB from the server
in each cold pass and the same 27,012,477 muon pairs in every pass:

| pass | Mac mini M2 Pro, 10 threads, far from the server | Linux, 64 threads, next to the server |
|---|--:|--:|
| 1. cold, byte cache | 105.0 s | 34.0 s |
| 2. warm, byte cache | 32.6 s (3.2x) | 17.0 s (2.0x) |
| 3. cold, replica | 105.0 s (1.0x) | 27.1 s (1.3x) |
| 4. warm, replica | 12.5 s (8.4x) | 9.5 s (3.6x) |

On the Mac both cold passes wait for the network, so converting the files
costs nothing and saves nothing on the first read; it pays off on every read
after it. On the Linux machine, pass 3 was likely helped by the server, which
had just served the same data in pass 1; and the warm passes probably read the
cache from memory, since the machine has room to keep it all.

The gain depends on how much of the job is waiting for data or decompressing
it, and so on how far away the server is. Other NanoAOD directories work too:
`root -l -b -q "$HOME/ucache/share/xrd-ucache/ucache_demo.C(\"root://host//dir\", 50)"`
reads the first 50 files of `dir`.

Your own jobs run exactly as before: the first run fills the cache, later runs
are served from it, and if anything goes wrong with the cache a read falls
back to the server rather than failing. `ucache summary` reports the time
saved once there is a run with `UCACHE_DISABLE=1` to compare with: uCache
reports a gain only when it has measured one, and a loss as a loss.

To switch it off, `unset XRD_PLUGIN`; to remove it,
`rm -rf ~/ucache /tmp/$USER/ucache`. The variables last only for this shell,
and while `XRD_PLUGIN` is set the XRootD client reads no plugin config file,
so any other client plugin configured on the machine is off.

## Using it for real

### Keep it on: one config file

A config file switches uCache on for every process you start, batch jobs
included, without any variables:

```sh
unset XRD_PLUGIN                                  # the file is not read while it is set
ucache setup --dir /path/on/a/local/disk/ucache   # writes ~/.xrootd/client.plugins.d/ucache.conf
ucache doctor
```

Keep `export PATH=$HOME/ucache/bin:$PATH` in your shell startup file for the
`ucache` command; the plugin itself needs nothing else. To switch uCache off,
`ucache disable`, or delete the file.

**Choose the disk with care.** It decides whether caching helps at all: on a
slow or network-backed volume a cache can be worse than reading the server.
Use a local SSD or NVMe, never AFS or NFS, and not a `/tmp` that the system
cleans. `ucache bench /path/to/candidate` measures a candidate in a few
minutes; [storage benchmarking](docs/BENCH.md) explains the result.

`setup` binds uCache to every server (`url = *`). To cache only some, name
them in the file: `url = eospublic.cern.ch;eoscms.cern.ch`. If you edit it by
hand, a `#` comment must start in the first column, and every value is taken
literally, with no `~` or `$HOME` expanded.

**Recompression (optional, off by default).** With `recompress = on` in the
file, a ROOT file compressed with LZMA or ZLIB is converted, the first time it
is read, into a form that is faster to decode, so later passes spend less time
unpacking. Before you turn it on:

> **Memory.** With it on, jobs hold more memory while they read. On the
> analyses measured, warm passes needed about 1.8x (TTree) and 2.3x (RNTuple)
> the memory the same job needs from a replica made by `ucache recompress`. If
> your jobs run short of memory, turn it off. Files already converted keep
> their layout until you remove them, while no job is reading them
> (`ucache untranspose <url>`, or `ucache clear`; a job still reading one
> would fail).

### Install for everyone on a machine: the RPM

An administrator can install uCache system-wide on EL9 (x86_64):

```sh
curl -LO https://github.com/xrootd/xrd-ucache/releases/latest/download/xrd-ucache-el9.x86_64.rpm
sudo dnf install ./xrd-ucache-el9.x86_64.rpm
```

It puts `ucache` in `/usr/bin` and the plugin in `/usr/lib64`, and requires no
XRootD package: the plugin runs inside whichever XRootD client a job uses. So
ROOT can come from the system (`sudo dnf install epel-release xrootd-client
root-netx`) or, for each user, from CVMFS, an LCG view or conda. Installing it
switches uCache on for nobody: each user does that as in "Try it", with
`XRD_PLUGIN=/usr/lib64/libXrdClUCache.so`, or with `ucache setup` above. The
check is the same too: `root -l -b -q /usr/share/xrd-ucache/ucache_demo.C`.

### macOS

On an Apple silicon Mac with macOS 11 or newer the steps are the same. You
need a ROOT that reads `root://`: tested with MacPorts' (`root6 +xrootd`);
Homebrew's and conda's are likely to work but are not tested.

```sh
root-config --has-xrootd                   # MacPorts: root-config6
mkdir -p ~/ucache
curl -L https://github.com/xrootd/xrd-ucache/releases/latest/download/xrd-ucache-macos-arm64.tar.gz \
  | tar -xz -C ~/ucache --strip-components=1
export PATH=$HOME/ucache/bin:$PATH
export XRD_PLUGIN=$HOME/ucache/lib/libXrdClUCache.so
export UCACHE_DIR=$HOME/ucache-cache
ucache doctor
root -l -b -q ~/ucache/share/xrd-ucache/ucache_demo.C   # MacPorts: root6
```

To build from source instead, see the [user
guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#build-from-source--macos).

Download it with `curl`, as above, not with a web browser: macOS marks files a
browser downloads as quarantined, and the XRootD client then cannot load the
plugin, without saying so.

## Testing

The self-contained suites live here: unit, differential, crash-recovery, soak
and fuzz tests. CI builds them and runs `ctest` on Linux and macOS for every
change, along with 200 kill-9 crash-recovery iterations; a nightly job repeats
the differential at a million operations and the crash loop at a thousand.

The XRootD client plugin is built and fuzzed against a live origin on Linux
only. The macOS job stops short of it, so there the plugin is exercised by hand
rather than in CI.

Further validation is performed with tools outside this repository.

## Support

- **Bugs, and anything worth a public record:** open an
  [issue](https://github.com/xrootd/xrd-ucache/issues); `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  says what is most useful to include.
- **Questions, and reports that carry site paths or dataset names:** write to
  <ucache-support@cern.ch>. It reaches the maintainer, accepts mail from any
  address, and is not public.

Either way, attach the output of `ucache doctor`, and the link `ucache publish`
prints or the output of `ucache summary --detail`: together they describe your
setup and what the cache did for your jobs, without naming the files they read.

## Development and AI assistance

Claude Code (Anthropic's agentic coding tool) was used in the development of
uCache and its documentation. The authors specified the requirements and
architecture, directed each change, and validated the implementation by its
measured behavior: unit, differential, crash-recovery and fuzz test suites run
under memory and race detectors; integration tests against real analysis
frameworks and storage services; and physics validation showing that cached and
direct analyses produce identical results at full dataset scale.
