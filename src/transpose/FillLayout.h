// The layout a TTree file is presented in while its replica is being created
// on the first read — computed from the file's metadata alone, before any
// basket has been fetched.
//
// A reader finds each basket through two numbers in the tree metadata:
// fBasketSeek[i] (where) and fBasketBytes[i] (how much to READ). How to decode
// the basket comes from its own key header (fNbytes, fObjlen) and frame
// headers, so a region longer than the basket is legal: the reader decodes
// fNbytes and ignores the rest. That is what lets this layout be fixed before
// any basket exists: every basket of a relocatable branch gets a SLOT of
// k x fBasketBytes[i] (k given in hundredths, the slot rounded down to a byte)
// in an extension past fEND, and the basket's recompressed record is written
// into it when the reader first asks for it.
//
// What the reader is shown, and what never changes for the life of a handle:
//   * the file header with fEND = the virtual end (promoted in place from the
//     32-bit to the 64-bit header layout when the virtual end passes 2^31);
//   * the keys-list record, in place, with the live tree entry pointing at the
//     relocated metadata key;
//   * at metaSeek, the relocated tree-metadata key: the ORIGINAL key header
//     with fNbytes and fSeekKey patched, and the tree record with every
//     relocated basket's seek and length pointing at its slot. It comes FIRST
//     in the extension so that a 32-bit keys-list entry can still address it;
//     the slots after it may lie anywhere, because fBasketSeek is 64-bit;
//   * fZipBytes (tree and branch) and fAutoFlush are NOT scaled: ROOT sizes
//     its read cache from them (TTree::GetCacheAutoSize), so the real total
//     keeps the cache, and the memory it takes, what it is for the original
//     file. A fill holding padded slots then splits into more requests.
//
// Rules this obeys, each checked against ROOT:
//   * no key header ever changes LENGTH — entry offsets inside a basket are
//     absolute positions that include it (an 8-byte change crashes ROOT);
//   * a slot's record carries fSeekKey = the slot's offset (ROOT rejects a
//     basket whose fSeekKey differs from where it was read);
//   * the rest of a slot is ZEROS: for an uncompressed basket ROOT keeps the
//     read length and parses what follows the record as a displacement array.
//
// Thread-safety: pure functions over caller-owned data; no shared state.
