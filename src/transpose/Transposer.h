// Native overlay builder: re-encodes a hot branch
// set's baskets to ZSTD-1 in an extension region, relocates the (patched)
// tree metadata, repoints the keys list at it in place, and emits the replica
// overlay — byte-for-byte the artifact the uproot-based reference builder
// produces (the differential gate), ready for ReplicaStore::publish.
//
// Sources: a plain file, or a v1 cache .data image where every range the
// build touches must be PRESENT in the entry's bitmap (deriveHotBranches
// only ever selects fully-cached branches, so `ucache materialize` works
// from cached bytes alone — no network in the CLI).
//
// Every failure returns Overlay{error}; the caller fails open (no replica).
//
// Thread-safety: pure functions over caller-owned data; no shared state.
