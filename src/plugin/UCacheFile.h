// XrdCl FilePlugIn gluing ucache-core to the client.
//
// Design invariants:
//  - The inner XrdCl::File is constructed with plugins DISABLED — no
//    recursion (asserted in tests).
//  - Classification (bitmap checks) happens on the caller's thread; disk
//    reads/writes and buffer assembly happen on the Executor; wire misses
//    are issued as ONE VectorRead of page-rounded, order-preserving,
//    coalesced ranges (§5.2 step 3); the user's completion is never delayed
//    by disk persistence (§5.2 step 4).
//  - Exactly one completion per request, statuses propagated faithfully;
//    any cache-side failure degrades to pure pass-through (§5.2 step 5);
//    after UCACHE_MAX_ERRORS consecutive cache errors the handle trips to
//    permanent pass-through (disabled_handles).
//  - No exceptions cross this ABI (§5.3).
//
// Lifetime: executor tasks and wire handlers capture only the shared
// HandleState (never `this`). Tasks that must touch the inner file go
// through HandleState::acquireInner/releaseInner; the plugin destructor
// invalidates and drains. PgRead is pass-through and never cached (§4.7:
// ROOT's path is Read/VectorRead; xrdcp's pgread traffic stays uncached) —
// EXCEPT on a transposed handle, where pass-through would
// return stale/missing bytes: there it is served from the stitched view
// with locally computed crc32c page checksums.
//
// A handle opened for a copy -- by a copy tool, XRootD's copy engine, ROOT's
// TFile::Cp or gfal2's xrootd plugin -- is pure pass-through: it reads the
// origin's bytes and never enters the cache (CopyDetect.h).
//
// Thread-safety: fully thread-safe; see HandleState.
