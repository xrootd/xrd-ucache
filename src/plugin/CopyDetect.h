// Which handles belong to a COPY rather than to a reader.
//
// uCache may show a reader a file in a layout of its own: a replica, or the
// slot layout recompression converts into as a job reads. Those layouts are a
// different, larger file than the one at the origin, and they read the same
// only to an application that follows the file's own offsets -- ROOT does. A
// copy does not: a copy tool reads bytes 0..size and writes them out, so a
// copy made through the cache would be the cache's layout, not the file. A
// copy is meant to be the origin's bytes.
//
// So a handle opened for a copy is passed straight through to the origin. It
// never uses the cache and never adds to it, and it answers every property the
// way the origin does (a checksum asked for at the end of a copy is the
// origin's). Two signals decide it, both when the handle opens:
//
//   - the program: xrdcp (and its xrdcopy alias), xrdfs, xrdadler32 and
//     edmCopyUtil only ever copy, so every read handle they open is a copy;
//     and hadd and ROOT's command-line tools (rootcp, rootls, ...) only merge,
//     copy or inspect files, so they are treated the same way: a merge that
//     copies baskets as it reads them, or a tool reporting a file's sizes and
//     codecs, must see the origin's file, not the cache's layout. Most of
//     ROOT's tools are Python scripts, recognised by the script the
//     interpreter runs;
//   - the call stack: a handle opened from inside XRootD's copy engine (the
//     one xrdcp, Python's XRootD.client.CopyProcess, gfal2 and rucio use), from
//     ROOT's static TFile::Cp or its file merger (TFileMerger, which hadd
//     uses, opening an input by name), or from gfal2's xrootd plugin.
//
// The stack check compares return addresses against address ranges that are
// resolved once per set of loaded libraries: the copy-engine functions are
// looked up in the very libXrdCl this plugin is bound to (only that library can
// route an open here), TFile::Cp in ROOT's I/O library once it is loaded, and
// gfal2's plugin by its file name. There is no symbol lookup per frame -- that
// is a linear scan of a library's symbol table under the loader's lock, per
// frame, per open.
//
// Both directions of error are safe. A copy that is not recognised reads
// through the cache as any reader does; a reader taken for a copy gets the
// origin's bytes, uncached. Neither hands anyone bytes in a layout it did not
// ask for: the program's name and the setting are fixed for the life of the
// process, and a copy handle never enters the per-process record of which
// layout a file was shown in.
//
// Recognised when the read shows it, not the opener: a handle whose FIRST
// request reads the whole file at once (fsspec's open().read(),
// cat_file(path, 0, size)) is a copy too, for a file with a slot store
// (UCacheFile.cc). A copy in pieces up to the origin's size that
// never reads the layout's own part is not a reader's pattern either, and is
// refused before it completes (CopyGuard.h).
//
// Not recognised, by construction: the whole layout the cache shows read in
// one request (cat_file(path, None, None)) or by a loop sized by the handle's
// own stat -- a valid file, but not the origin's -- the pieces of one copy spread over several handles or processes,
// fast cloning or inspection inside a program of the user's own
// (TTree::CloneTree(-1, "fast"), TTree::Print on a file it opened to analyse),
// a merge of files the program opened itself before handing them to
// TFileMerger, and a copy through an XRootD proxy or a FUSE mount that has
// uCache inside it. Those copy with the cache switched off.
//
// This file has no XRootD dependency, so it is unit-tested on its own.
//
// Thread-safety: every function here may be called concurrently from any
// thread. The address table is immutable once built and is published through
// an atomic pointer (a replaced table is kept, linked from the one that
// replaced it); a thread that sees the set of loaded libraries change builds a
// fresh one without taking a lock (so a process that forks while another
// thread is building cannot inherit a held lock).
