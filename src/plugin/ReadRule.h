// The max_read_fraction rule. A process that asks for more than the limit of
// a ROOT file's data gains nothing from caching it -- it would fill the cache
// with the file -- so it reads that file straight from the origin: what it
// fetches is not kept, while bytes already cached are still served.
//
// Decided once per file per process, early, and not checked again. The share
// is the bytes the branches (RNTuple: columns) read so far hold in the file
// over the bytes of every branch -- the part of each entry's data the reader
// asks for, from the file's own metadata (ReadMap). Read directly as soon as
// it exceeds the limit; cached for good as soon as a request of two or more
// branches adds none (the reader has come back to branches it read before).
// Until then the file is cached as usual.
//
// The map is parsed only when a request needs the origin, so a warm pass
// never pays for it. The file's own records (header, keys list, tree record,
// RNTuple envelopes) are cached as usual whatever the decision. Files smaller
// than kMinBytes, files that are not TTree or RNTuple, and a limit of 100 have
// no rule: they are cached as before.
//
// Thread-safety: all methods are thread-safe. A rule is shared by every handle
// of the file in the process and lives for the process.
