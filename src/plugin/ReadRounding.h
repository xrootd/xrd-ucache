// ends mid-page leaves those edge pages unstored. A later request asks for
// every page it overlaps, edge pages included, and therefore misses -- refetches
// the same span, stores nothing new, and misses again on every pass after that.
// Rounding the fetched span out to page boundaries is what makes a request
// cacheable at all, and it costs at most two extra pages on the wire.
//
// This holds for every wire request, with no exception for vector reads. Their
// elements are size-capped, but that is a reason to CUT a rounded span into
// legal pieces (readvElemEnd below), never a reason to leave it unrounded:
// declining to round never made an oversized element legal — the request still
// failed — it only made the bytes uncacheable on top.
