// The slot store: where a file's converted records live once the file has been
// shown in its slot layout (transpose/FillLayout.h). The layout is the file's
// address space from its first open on, for every process and every open, so a
// reader that holds its offsets can close and reopen at any time.
//
// One file per entry, beside the byte cache's .data/.meta: <hash>.slots
//   [0, 4 KiB)           header, written once: what the layout was made for
//                        (validators, slot factor, codecs), the store's random
//                        id, and the layout blob's length and CRC
//   [4 KiB, ...)         the layout blob, written once: the layout itself,
//                        computed by whoever created the store and served
//                        as-is by everyone after -- never recomputed
//   then commit blocks   each 4 KiB-aligned: a block header, the entries it
//                        commits, then their records
//
// A record's CRC32C is seeded with the store id, the slot and the length, so a
// record only ever validates as the record it was written as, in the store it
// was written to. The last valid entry for a slot wins. A block that a crash
// cut short is stepped over: its header or its records fail their checks.
//
// A DECLINED store has a header and no layout: the file is not served in a
// slot layout, and nobody need parse it again to find that out.
//
// Concurrency: commits from every process are serialized by an exclusive
// flock on the file, taken only by a thread that may wait; reading new blocks
// takes the shared lock without waiting, and is simply skipped when a commit
// holds it. A commit refuses (-ESTALE) once the path no longer names the file
// it has open -- the store was dropped or replaced. Requires a local
// filesystem, as the byte cache's own locking does.
//
// Thread-safety: every method is thread-safe. One SlotStore object may be used
// by all threads of a process; several processes may each have their own.
