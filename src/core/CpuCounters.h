// Per-process CPU accounting for the run record: how much work a run did, and
// how much of its wall the machine actually spent doing it.
//
// Two sources, deliberately both:
//
// * `getrusage` — CPU time for the whole process, always available. Complete,
//   but coarse: it cannot separate work from spin, and it says nothing about
//   how efficiently the work executed.
// * `perf_event_open` — retired instructions and cycles. Precise, and their
//   ratio is the only way to tell "the same job ran slower" from "a different
//   job ran". BUT the counters can only start when this object is built, and
//   the plugin is loaded on the first client call — so a process that spends
//   time before touching a file has that time in rusage and NOT in the
//   counters. Consumers must treat instruction totals as "since the cache
//   engaged", never as "for the process".
//
// Instruction totals are the work fingerprint: two runs that executed the same
// number of instructions did the same computation, which is what makes their
// walls comparable. Measured on this project, a cached and a cache-disabled run
// of one job agreed to 2.5% on instructions and 0.6% on cycles while their
// walls differed 2.5x.
//
// perf_event_open is unavailable under some kernel settings and in some
// containers. That is not an error: the counters simply report zero and every
// consumer falls back to rusage.
//
// Thread-safety: open/read from any thread; the counters aggregate all threads
// of this process (inherit=1). Reads are independent.

// How wide a run COULD go, measured rather than declared.

// The job's own thread setting is invisible from here and must stay that way,
// so the question is turned around: what is the most parallelism this run ever
// actually reached? CPU time sampled once a second gives cores-busy per
// interval, and the MAXIMUM over the run is the answer. A job limited to eight
// threads can never exceed eight cores, not even for one second; a job given
// thirty-two still bursts to thirty-two whenever data is there, however
// starved it is on average. So the peak reflects the ceiling the job was
// given, while the mean reflects how well it was fed -- and the two together
// say whether a run used the resources it had.
//
// Two measures that were tried and are worse: threads ALIVE counts every
// thread the process owns (33 for an eight-core job, 640 for an RNTuple one,
// and it differs by route for the same job), and threads that ever used CPU,
// even weighted by how much, returns the same 33 because ROOT spreads work
// across its whole arena.
//
// Sampling must be driven by something that happens THROUGHOUT the run. Driven
// by file opens it measured the opening burst and nothing else, and reported a
// peak of 1 core for a 32-thread job -- opens all land before the compute
// starts. Reads run for the whole run, so that is where it is called from, and
// the once-a-second check is a lock-free load so a hot path can afford it.
