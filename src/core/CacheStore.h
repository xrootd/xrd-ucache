// Process-wide cache root: entry registry, validation policy, eviction,
// stats dump.
//
// One FileEntry per key per process (refcounted via shared_ptr; concurrent
// IMT streams share state). Eviction purges LRU-by-atime whole entries from
// HIGH_WATER down to LOW_WATER under the cache-wide LOCK flock, skipping
// pinned entries; entries unlinked while open keep serving via their fd.
//
// Budget: by DEFAULT the cache uses the disk and evicts to
// keep a statvfs free-disk FLOOR (minFreeBytes, auto-set from the disk) — an
// active session fills most of the disk and reclaims LRU under pressure. The
// floor uses statvfs directly (no per-startup scan) and is the accurate
// cross-process guard. An OPTIONAL hard byte cap (maxBytes, via UCACHE_MAX_BYTES)
// adds a second trigger driven by a per-process running usage total (approxUsage_:
// seeded once when the cap is set, adjusted on page-write, reconciled to an
// authoritative scan after every evictNow) — cheap but per-process, hence
// best-effort under concurrency. Eviction checks run on both open() and the
// page-write path, rate-limited by evictCheckSeconds.
//
// Thread-safety: fully thread-safe (registry mutex; Stats + approxUsage_
// atomics; eviction serialized cross-process by flock and in-process by a mutex).
