// One cached object: sparse .data file + .meta sidecar.
//
// The contract the plugin builds on:
//   hasRange()   — atomic-chunk classification (all pages present?)
//   readCached() — HIT path; per-page CRC verified; false => fall back to
//                  origin (bad pages marked absent, crc_failures counted).
//                  On false the caller's buffer holds UNDEFINED bytes: a
//                  contiguous run of pages is read with ONE pread and
//                  verified afterwards, so unverified bytes may already have
//                  landed there. The caller must treat the whole request as
//                  unserved and overwrite the entire span.
//   writePages() — MISS path; persists every *full* page inside the span
//                  (tail page special-cased), data-before-bit ordering,
//                  UCACHE_FSYNC honored; backend errors fail open (page
//                  skipped, failopen_events counted) and never throw
//
// Fill buffer: with fill_buffer_mb > 0 (default),
// writePages STAGES pages in RAM instead of writing them; staged pages are
// part of the presence contract (hasRange/readCached serve them), so a
// cold fill performs NO random IO against the cache disk. The stage drains
// as offset-sorted coalesced writes (flushBuffer) on: per-entry cap,
// process-wide cap, meta_flush_seconds interval, entry close, and the
// eviction/cleanup flush. Durability ordering is unchanged — bytes (+
// fdatasync per UCACHE_FSYNC) land before bits are published; a crash
// loses at most the staged pages, never consistency. Staged-but-unflushed
// bytes are invisible to cachedBytes()/usage until flushed (eviction
// flushes first). fill_buffer_mb = 0 restores the legacy immediate path.
//
// Cross-process: several processes may hold the same entry open and fill
// different ranges of it (one job per chunk; several jobs on one node). Page
// data is idempotent, so the .data writes never conflict. The sidecar is
// shared state and is COMMITTED, never replaced: every store re-reads the
// image on disk under the entry lock, applies only the pages this handle set
// or cleared since its last store (plus a pin it changed), stores the result
// and adopts it, so a sibling's pages are served here as well. A fresh
// entry's empty sidecar is stored at open, under the same lock, so a second
// opener joins the fill instead of truncating it.
//
// Thread-safety: fully thread-safe. A single mutex guards bitmap/CRC/meta
// state AND the two stage maps; data-file pread/pwrite run outside the
// lock (page writes are idempotent-same-bytes; presence bits only ever
// transition absent→present under the lock, and present→absent only on
// CRC failure, a punch, or a commit adopting a sibling's clear). At most one buffer flush runs at a time
// (flushInProgress_ + condvar); staged pages stay readable during their
// flush via the flushing_ map. At most one sidecar commit runs at a time
// (commitMu_, taken before mu_): the flock around a commit keeps other
// processes out, but every thread here shares one descriptor, which flock
// does not divide. A range release holds off buffer flushes, and the staging
// of the pages it releases, until its punch is done.
