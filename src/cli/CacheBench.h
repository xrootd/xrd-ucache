// Measure a storage location through uCache's OWN code, rather than through a
// hand-written imitation of it.
//
// The raw-storage stages in DiskBench are a frozen yardstick: fixed block sizes
// and queue depths, comparable across versions and machines. They cannot answer
// "what does uCache get here", because a model of the fill is a model — the
// previous one was pessimistic on three counts (no RAM staging, no offset
// sorting, no coalescing) and still 1.43x optimistic against a real cold fill.
//
// So this drives FileEntry/CacheStore directly. Staging, the per-entry buffer
// cap, offset-sorted coalesced drains, crc-at-staging, bitmap publication,
// sidecar rewrites, read-run coalescing and per-page verification are all the
// product's, not a reproduction. The ONLY thing still modelled is the order in
// which offsets arrive; replaying a captured trace would remove that too.
//
// Two phases, because they are two different passes a real workload makes and
// they have different limits:
//   FILL — a cold pass does essentially zero cache-disk reads (staged pages
//          serve the client), so a cold pass is a WRITE load and this measures it.
//   READ — a warm pass, with the page cache dropped first and every byte read
//          exactly once, at both tier shapes (scattered ~48 KiB = byte cache,
//          sequential ~512 KiB = replica).
//
// Numbers here are properties of a RELEASE, not of the device alone: change the
// staging policy and they move. The record carries the build id for that reason.
//
// Thread-safety: runCacheBench is single-caller; it spawns and joins its own
// workers.
