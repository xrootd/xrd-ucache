// `ucache bench`: raw storage self-test of the cache dir (or any
// candidate dir). Measures the access patterns ucache actually generates —
// random small reads at several stream counts (hit serving; flat scaling
// exposes QoS quotas), large-block reads and writes at several stream counts
// (the replica pattern), sequential read, reads under writeback (the observed
// production killer mode), create/unlink (cleanup). RAW numbers only — no
// verdicts; recommendations become a doctor feature once fleet data exists.
// The FILL is deliberately not among them: an imitation of it measured 1.4x
// FASTER than a real cold fill of the same data on the same disk, so it was
// retired rather than tuned and the product's own code measures it instead
// (--cache-path, CacheBench.h).
//
// Methodology (hardened by field probe failures): keep the page cache out of
// the measurement, use a dedicated non-sparse test file (never reads cache
// objects — sparse holes measure nothing), and time-cap every phase so the
// tool still finishes on a volume that delivers a few dozen IOPS.
//
// HOW the page cache is kept out differs by platform, and the difference is
// reported rather than hidden — the `mode` field says which was used:
//   Linux   O_DIRECT, a guarantee with an alignment contract; buffered plus
//           posix_fadvise-evict where the filesystem refuses it.
//   macOS   F_NOCACHE, set after open. It ASKS the kernel not to cache this
//           file's data: no alignment contract, no promise that a given
//           transfer bypassed the cache, and no way to drop pages already
//           resident. Measured latencies show it working (device-real
//           microseconds, not RAM), but a macOS figure is not interchangeable
//           with an O_DIRECT one and should not be put in the same table
//           without saying so.
// macOS also has no per-device counters (/proc/diskstats) and no iowait, so
// the record omits those fields instead of substituting weaker ones; the
// device is named but not described.
//
// Three properties the numbers depend on, and which the output therefore
// states outright:
//   - Every phase cycles inside the one test file, so a long window on a fast
//     device cannot grow it beyond --size. The --cache-path stage is the
//     exception and is bounded by volume instead: it RETAINS what it writes,
//     because a cache does.
//   - Writing to fresh extents is not the same measurement as writing over
//     allocated ones. The test-file build pays allocation and the in-place
//     write does not, so their ratio is the cost of allocating on this device —
//     nothing on one disk measured here, nearly 2x on another of the same model.
//   - A rate is only a device property if the write finished. The build stage is
//     time-capped, and a capped run reports what that slow episode achieved
//     rather than what the device can do; `stopped at time cap` says which.
//
// Every run also appends a record to a log file (default `ucache-bench.txt`
// in the working directory) carrying the numbers plus the context needed to
// read them later: the exact command, the time, the mount and block device
// behind the target directory, and the machine's CPU and IO load.
//
// Thread-safety: runDiskBench is single-caller (CLI); it spawns and joins its
// own worker threads internally.
