# Metrics

The numbers uCache records about your jobs: what each one means, and the format
of the JSON files it writes.

**To simply see how your cache is doing, run `ucache stats`** — it prints a
human-readable summary of these same numbers. This file is for reading the raw
JSON, or building tooling on it. The user guide's monitoring section explains
how to read the printed summary.

## Which number answers which question

| question | look at |
|---|---|
| Is the cache being used at all? | `opens`, `files_opened`, `hit_bytes` |
| Did a warm pass avoid the network? | `origin_bytes` — 0 means everything came from local disk |
| Is anything wrong? | `crc_failures`, `failopen_events`, `validations_failed` — **all three should be 0** |
| Is the cache big enough? | `admissions_bypassed`, `evicted_bytes`, `evicted_entries` |
| Where did the bytes come from? | `ram_hit_bytes`, `hit_bytes`, `replica_bytes_served`, `miss_bytes`, `relay_bytes` |
| Is the job re-reading the same data? | `opens` / `files_opened`, `first_touch_bytes` against `hit_bytes` |
| What is the cache disk being asked to do? | `hit_disk_reads`, `hit_disk_bytes`, `replica_reads`, `replica_read_bytes`, `hist_*_read_bytes` |
| Is the cache disk keeping up? | `buffer_stalls`, `buffer_stall_us`, `hist_hit_read_us`, `hist_flush_write_us` |
| Did the replica tier get used? | `replica_opens`, `replica_published`, `replica_bytes_served` |
| Were replicas created as files were read? | `cold_replica_files`, `cold_replica_in_bytes`, `cold_replica_baskets_kept`, `cold_replica_declined` |

## Where the numbers are written

These records are also what `ucache summary` and `ucache history` read: the
file name carries the store's start time and the last line carries its end, so
one process's work is bracketed without any periodic sampling, and the
`.files.jsonl` companion says which entries the bytes belonged to. Consumers
should take the file name's `<start_ts>` as the start of the run.

One JSON line is appended to `$UCACHE_DIR/stats/<host>-<pid>-<start_ts>-<seq>.jsonl`
at every `CacheStore::dumpStats()`: explicit calls, store destruction, the
plugin's `atexit`, and **every `meta_flush_seconds` (default 30 s) while the
process runs**. That periodic line is what keeps a run visible when its
process exits without running destructors — Python's `multiprocessing` and
`concurrent.futures` workers `_exit()`, which skips `atexit` too — so such a
run is at most one period short instead of absent. Counters are cumulative,
so consumers take the last complete line. External tooling consumes these —
the schema is a correctness surface; changes require updating this file and
the consumers together.

## Field notes

What each counter means, and the reasoning behind the ones that are easy to
misread. Three words recur. The **byte tier** is the page-granular copy of the
original file — the ordinary cache. The **replica tier** is a recompressed
overlay built by `ucache recompress`, which serves the same data with less
decompression work; a cache with recompression off has none. A **sidecar** is
the small file beside each cached entry holding its page bitmap and checksums.
[How it works](USER_GUIDE.md#how-it-works-briefly) covers the tiers, and
[FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md) the files.

### Bytes and where they came from

Every read is served from somewhere, and the counters name the source. Bytes
served locally are `hit_bytes` (byte tier) and `replica_bytes_served` (replica
tier); bytes that had to be fetched are `miss_bytes`; bytes the cache never
touched at all are `relay_bytes`. On a warm pass the fetched figure should be
zero.

- `origin_bytes` — bytes requested from the origin **after page rounding**, so
  it is the numerator of read amplification: divide by the bytes the job asked
  for to see how much extra the cache pulled to satisfy them.
- Which layer maintains which counter, when tracing an unexpected value back to
  its source: `miss_bytes`/`served_bytes`/`origin_reads`/`origin_readvs` are
  incremented by the plugin layer; the core owns `opens`, `hit_bytes`,
  `page_writes`, `crc_failures`, `meta_corrupt`, `validations_failed`,
  `evicted_*`, `failopen_events`.

### Capacity, and things going wrong

These are the counters to read first when something looks off. `crc_failures`,
`failopen_events` and `validations_failed` should all be zero. By contrast
`admissions_bypassed` is not a fault at all — it records a deliberate decision
not to cache, and says the cache is under pressure rather than broken.

- `admissions_bypassed` — files NOT cached because every resident entry was
  still inside the eviction protection window (`evict_protect_seconds`), so the
  cache had stopped growing rather than evict data a running job still needs.
  These reads SUCCEED, uncached. Deliberately separate from `failopen_events`:
  that counter means something went wrong, while this is a capacity decision. A
  non-zero value here means the cache is too small for the working set — see
  `ucache status`, which names the remedy.
- `validations_failed` — cached entries discarded because they no longer
  matched the file at the origin: a different size, mtime or checksum, or a
  changed page size. The entry is refetched from scratch, so a read still
  succeeds; a steadily rising count means the data is being rewritten
  underneath the cache.
- `crc_failures` — pages that failed CRC on read and were quarantined
  (refetched later). `meta_corrupt` — sidecars that failed to load (torn or
  damaged) and were rebuilt.
- `failopen_events` — cache-side faults that degraded to pass-through
  (failed page writes, failed sidecar persists). `disabled_handles` —
  handles that tripped `UCACHE_MAX_ERRORS` (plugin layer).
- `copier_handles` (plugin layer) — file handles opened for a copy: by a copy
  tool (`xrdcp`, `xrdfs`, `xrdadler32`, `edmCopyUtil`), by `hadd` or one of
  ROOT's command-line tools, from inside XRootD's copy engine, from ROOT's
  `TFile::Cp` or `TFileMerger`, or from gfal2's xrootd plugin. They are
  served as pure pass-through, so a copy is the origin's bytes: their reads
  are in `relay_bytes`, and they add nothing to the cache. Also counted: a
  handle whose first request read the whole file at once, for a file with a
  compact replica or a slot store. Zero with `copy_detect = off`.
- `copies_refused` (plugin layer) — requests refused because they would have
  completed a copy, in pieces up to the origin's size, of a file shown in a
  replica's layout (the handle read all of [0, origin size) without reading
  any of the replica's own part first): the copy fails with an error naming
  `UCACHE_DISABLE=1` instead of coming out corrupt. Not a cache error: never
  in `failopen_events`.
- `direct_read_files` / `direct_read_bytes` (plugin layer) — ROOT files this
  process decided to read straight from the origin because its reads covered
  branches holding more than `max_read_fraction` of the file's data, and the
  bytes it fetched for their data and did not keep (also in `relay_bytes`).
  A file is counted once per process. Zero with `max_read_fraction = 100`.
- `open_retries` / `open_retries_exhausted` (plugin layer) —
  transient inner-open failures re-attempted (`UCACHE_OPEN_RETRIES`), and opens
  that ultimately gave up after retrying. Uncounted when caching is off (retry
  still works, just unrecorded — no store to hold the counters).

### Replica tier

Only meaningful once `ucache recompress` has built overlays; all zero
otherwise. They track the life of an overlay: built, adopted for serving,
rejected, or cleaned up. See the replica section of [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md).

- `replica_opens` — overlays adopted for serving, after the full verification
  done when the entry is opened.
- `replica_published` — overlays successfully built and made available.
- `replica_invalid` — overlays rejected at open as torn, stale or mismatched;
  each rejection also drops the overlay.
- `replica_crc_failures` — overlay pages whose checksum did not match, at open
  or while serving.
- `replica_punched_bytes` — original bytes reclaimed once an overlay covered
  them, freeing the space the byte-tier copy held.
- `replica_orphans_swept` — leftover overlay files removed by eviction, after a
  crash or a version change.

### Replicas created as files are read

With `recompress = on`, a file that has no replica gets a slot store on its
first open, and every basket a job reads that the store does not hold yet is
converted as it arrives -- on the first pass, and later for branches read for
the first time. All zero otherwise. `ucache stats` prints them on one
`converted on read` line. For an RNTuple file, read "page" wherever these say
"basket".

- `cold_replica_files` — slot stores created.
- `cold_replica_in_bytes` / `cold_replica_out_bytes` — original basket bytes
  converted, and the converted records they became (ZSTD-1, or uncompressed
  where ZSTD could not shrink a basket).
- `cold_replica_baskets` — baskets converted.
- `cold_replica_baskets_kept` — baskets kept exactly as stored because their
  converted form did not fit their slot, or they could not be decoded. Their
  original bytes are the byte cache's share of such a file. (Branches whose
  codec is not in `recompress_codecs` are not counted: they are never
  converted.)
- `cold_replica_convert_us` — time spent converting, summed over the threads that did
  it; it is CPU a pass spends that a pass without recompression does not.
- `cold_replica_declined` — converted records not kept: they still did not fit
  above the free-space floor after an eviction pass, writing them failed (the
  log says which), the store was removed meanwhile, or the process already held
  its limit of records waiting to be written. They were served to the job that
  read them; a later read converts them again.

Records a job reads from a slot store count in `replica_bytes_served` (and
their reads from the cache disk in `replica_reads` / `replica_read_bytes`);
records it converts from what the origin sends count in `miss_bytes`, as any
first read does, so the pass that makes a store reads as a fill. The zeros
that pad each slot count in neither.

`ucache summary` never takes a run that converted baskets this way as its
baseline: its time includes the cache's own conversion work. A plain first pass
that only filled the byte cache is unaffected and still qualifies under the
usual rules.

### What the printed summary is derived from

`ucache stats` does the divisions in its `workflow:` block from the counters
below — how often each file was opened, which tier served what, how much of the
reading was re-reading, and what the cache disk was asked to do.

- Workflow counters: `files_opened` — distinct keys opened by this process
  (`opens/files_opened` ≫ 1 = a reopen loop); `ram_hit_bytes` — hit bytes
  served from the fill buffer's staged RAM (subset of `hit_bytes`);
  `first_touch_bytes` — bytes served for the first time in the entry's
  in-process lifetime (the rest are re-reads).
- Byte-tier disk reads: `hit_disk_reads` /
  `hit_disk_bytes` / `hit_disk_seq` — byte-tier disk reads, their bytes, and
  how many continued sequentially from the previous read. **One
  `hit_disk_reads` is one pread covering a whole contiguous run of cached
  pages, not one per page** — a request spanning ten adjacent pages costs one
  read op — so `hit_disk_bytes / hit_disk_reads` is the mean size the device
  sees and `hit_disk_reads` divided by wall time is the op rate it is charged
  for (the currency on IOPS-quota storage). Bytes are counted at whole-page
  granularity, since each page is still checksummed in full. `hit_disk_bytes`
  is directly comparable to versions before reads were coalesced for every
  request that SUCCEEDS (verified byte-identical on the same workload). It
  differs only for a request that fails part way: the older per-page loop had
  already read some pages before discovering an absent one, whereas the planning
  pass now finds that page first and reads nothing — so a run with a non-zero
  acceptance triple can show slightly fewer bytes than an older one.

- Replica-tier reads: `replica_bytes_served` / `replica_reads` /
  `replica_read_bytes` — bytes served from replica overlays, the physical `.tdata` preads that delivered
  them, and the bytes those preads moved (the replica-tier analogue of the
  byte-tier trio, coalesced the same way; `replica_read_bytes` ≥
  `replica_bytes_served` because whole overlay pages are read and verified,
  and a page read for two different user reads counts twice).
- Pass-through and vector reads: `relay_bytes` — pure pass-through, the cache
  never touched them (copies included: see `copier_handles`; files read directly
  too: see `direct_read_files`); `readv_chunks` /
  `readv_calls` / `readv_mixed` — vector-read chunks seen, vector reads the
  cache handled (`readv_chunks / readv_calls` = mean batch width), and
  vectors mixing hits with misses.
- Fill path: `flush_runs` / `flush_run_bytes` — coalesced fill-buffer pwrite
  runs and their bytes; `buffer_stalls` / `buffer_stall_us` — fills that had
  to drain synchronously at the buffer cap, and the wall time lost;
  `fetches_joined` — misses that joined an identical in-flight fetch instead
  of fetching again.
- Read-ahead (`prefetch`, OFF by default; when switched on the plugin predicts a TTree reader's
  next fill from the file's own basket map and fetches it while the reader
  computes, into RAM only): `prefetch_issued_bytes` — asked of the origin ahead
  of demand; `prefetch_served_bytes` — of those, bytes the reader then
  demanded (they also count as hits); `prefetch_refetched_bytes` — served
  bytes a demand read had fetched again in the meantime; `prefetch_dropped_unread`
  — bytes read ahead that the reader never asked for, dropped from RAM and
  never written to the cache; `prefetch_late_bytes` — arrived after the demand
  read had already brought them; `prefetch_parses` — basket maps parsed
  (successes; a map is retried while the reader's header pages are still being
  staged, and those attempts do not count);
  `prefetch_bridge_bytes` — padding between two predicted ranges, fetched to
  save a request element and discarded on arrival (`prefetch_bridge_kb`):
  bandwidth only, never staged, never cached, and never counted against
  read-ahead's own accuracy; `prefetch_disabled` — 1 once a
  process switched read-ahead off, so a total over several processes is a
  count of how many did; `prefetch_fetch_errors` — read-ahead
  wire reads that failed (dropped; never a fail-open event). `fetches_joined` counts the reads that waited for a fetch already on the
  wire rather than sending their own, which is how read-ahead stops paying
  for the same bytes twice (`prefetch_join`). Read-ahead's wire
  traffic is counted in `origin_bytes` and `origin_readvs`, as any other origin
  read, but NOT in `hist_origin_rt_us`: that histogram is time a reader waited,
  and nobody waited for these. A run that read ahead at all is never taken as a
  no-cache baseline by `summary`, whether or not the prediction was used.
  Per file, `prefetch_issued` / `prefetch_served` / `prefetch_dropped` in the
  `.files.jsonl` record.
- Histograms are log2 buckets: bucket *i* counts samples with
  `floor(log2(v)) == i` (bucket 0 = ≤1); arrays are trimmed of trailing
  zeros, 40 buckets max. The `_us` ones bucket microseconds; the
  `_bytes` ones bucket bytes (bucket 12 = 4 KiB, 16 = 64 KiB).
- Read-shape histograms answer "what is the storage actually asked for":
  `hist_req_read_bytes` — sizes the client requested (one sample per read
  and per vector-read chunk, before the cache decides how to serve them);
  `hist_hit_read_bytes` / `hist_replica_read_bytes` — sizes of the preads
  each tier issued. Issued sizes *smaller* than requested are normal on a
  partially cached entry, because a read stops at any page that is absent or
  still staged in RAM, and at the coalescing cap; issued sizes *larger* than
  requested come from rounding out to whole pages. What the pair is for is the
  shape of the tail: many issued reads far smaller than the requests they serve
  means the entry is fragmented, and on op-priced storage that is what costs.
- `entries` — per-entry page coverage of entries live in the process at dump
  time (`cached_bytes / file_size` = the coverage signal gating replica
  materialization). Closed entries' coverage persists in their
  sidecars and is aggregated by `ucache stats` from there.
- `handles_high_water` — the most cache-engaged handles open at once in this
  process. The origin's delivery is a non-monotone function of concurrency, so
  measurements at different widths are not interchangeable; consumers pool runs
  across time only when this agrees. Aggregated across processes it is a MAX,
  never a sum.
- `disabled` — present (as `1`) when the process ran with `UCACHE_DISABLE`:
  the cache was out of the loop and every byte was relayed. Such a run is a
  measured NO-CACHE BASELINE; `ucache summary`/`history` compare cached runs
  against it, matched by key through the per-file records.
- `threads_high_water` — the most threads this process had alive at once,
  every thread it owns, not the ones doing the work. Recorded, not a width:
  a runtime's worker pool inflates it freely.
- `peak_cores` — the most cores busy in any one second, from CPU time sampled
  once a second on the read path. This IS a width: CPU seconds per wall second
  cannot exceed the cores actually executing. Sampled where reads happen, not
  where files open, because opens all land before the work starts and would
  report one core for a job running on thirty-two.
- `cpu_us`, `instructions`, `cycles` — work done, as opposed to time taken.
  Instructions are the stable one across routes: the same analysis over the
  same data executes very nearly the same number however the bytes reached it,
  which is what makes two runs comparable at all. Requires performance counters
  to be permitted; absent (zero) where they are not.
- `origin_reads_in_flight_high_water` — the most reads the ORIGIN was being
  asked for at once. Counted where a read is issued to the origin and given
  back at the top of its completion handler, so it spans the READ. This is the
  width that sets the origin's delivery rate, and it is the one to use. A warm
  run reads 0, correctly: nothing was outstanding at the origin because nothing
  went there. It is recorded and displayed; nothing is decided from it.
- `reads_in_flight_high_water` — SUPERSEDED by the counter above, and kept only
  so the old name is not silently reused for the new meaning. It counted reads
  being SET UP at once: every route dispatches and returns while a synchronous
  caller waits above this library, so it spans the handoff, not the read, and a
  job with thirty-two reads genuinely outstanding can report a handful. It is
  emitted as a permanent 0. Do not read anything into it.
- Counters are process-lifetime monotonic; successive lines from one process
  supersede earlier ones (consumers take the last line per file).

## Companion files (same stem)

- `<stem>.files.jsonl` — one record per entry per process lifetime, emitted
  once (at last release, or at the final dump). A handle the cache never
  served — pass-through under `UCACHE_DISABLE`, a copy, or a write-opened file — also
  leaves one at close, with the relayed bytes under `wire_bytes` and the
  cache-side fields zero; that is what makes a baseline run matchable file by
  file. Consumed by
  `ucache stats --files`:

  ```json
  {"ts": 0, "key": "root://…", "opens": 0, "served_bytes": 0, "ram_bytes": 0,
   "replica_bytes": 0, "disk_reads": 0, "disk_seq": 0, "disk_bytes": 0,
   "first_touch_bytes": 0, "wire_bytes": 0, "direct_bytes": 0, "span_us": 0,
   "origin_size": 0, "read_sig": "", "read_buckets": 0, "mode": "cached"}
  ```

  `direct_bytes` are the bytes a file read directly (`max_read_fraction`)
  fetched and did not keep. `mode` is `fill` when the process mostly fetched
  the file, `relay` when it mostly read it straight from the origin (a file
  read directly), and `cached` otherwise.

  `origin_size` is the file's size at the origin — the one measure of a file
  that means the same thing whichever route served it, and therefore the only
  sound weight when combining files.

  `read_sig` and `read_buckets` say WHICH parts of the file were read, and how
  many, in the ORIGINAL file's coordinates. The file is divided into 1 MiB
  blocks and the signature is a hash of the set that were touched; a read
  served from a replica is mapped back through the sidecar's origin map first,
  so the two routes are expressed in the same coordinates.

  That is not the same as agreeing, and MEASURED THEY DO NOT ALWAYS AGREE. A
  replica is a rewritten container, so the reader asks it for different spans
  than it asks the original -- not merely coalesced differently, requested
  differently. On a recorded file set, 26 files of 439 (94.1% agreement) had a
  whole block fall inside a gap the replica route never asks for: the byte
  route marked it, the replica route did not. Both are honest about what was
  read; they answer slightly different questions.

  So equality is evidence of the same work, while inequality is NOT proof of
  different work -- which is why runs are compared on the SHARE of files that
  agree rather than on a single hash over the whole run, and why that share is
  required to be high rather than total.

  An empty `read_sig` means UNKNOWN, never "nothing was read" — a replica
  written before origin maps existed cannot answer, and so says nothing rather
  than something wrong. Treat it as no evidence.

  **A consumer reading these must take the record with the most
  `read_buckets`, not the last one.** A file can be reported more than once in
  a process, and the footprint grows for as long as the process runs, so
  earlier records hold subsets of later ones. Taking the last record is right
  for every other field here and wrong for this one.

  `span_us` is the wall this file was live and working, from open to last
  activity. Where one worker handles one file at a time that is the worker's
  full cost for it — waits and the route's own CPU together — which is what
  makes files served by different routes comparable. `mode` is `cached`,
  `fill` (this process mostly fetched it) or `relay` (passed through, including
  a `UCACHE_DISABLE` run).

- `<stem>.trace.jsonl` — sampled per-operation IO trace, written only with
  `trace = io` (every `trace_sample`-th operation per class). Records are
  `{"t": <wall µs>, "w": <worker slot>, "op": "<operation>", "k": "<16-hex key
  hash>", "off": 0, "len": 0, "us": 0}`; `w` is a small per-thread slot id,
  assigned on that thread's first record and stable for its life, so a consumer
  can reconstruct each worker's timeline — the gap between one worker's
  completion and its next issue is that worker's compute. The first record for
  each key is a legend line
  `{"op": "key", "k": "<hash>", "url": "<full url>"}` mapping the hash back
  to the URL.
