# uCache — User Guide

`ucache` is a transparent, per-user read cache for remote ROOT/XRootD data. You
install it once; thereafter every `root://…` file your jobs read is cached on
local disk, so the **second and later** passes over the same data read from your
NVMe instead of the network. Nothing in your analysis code changes.

It is safe by construction: if anything goes wrong (bad cache dir, disk full,
version mismatch, corruption) it **fails open** — your job still runs correctly,
just without the speedup.

## 1. Install (no root — like everything else here)

Unpack the release tarball into your home:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local
tar -C ~/.local --strip-components=1 -xf xrd-ucache-<version>-el9-x86_64.tar.gz
ucache doctor      # expect FAILs for cache dir + activation — §2 fixes both;
                   # the `plugin loads` line is what confirms the install
```

That's the whole install: `bin/ucache`, `bin/ucache-netbench`, and the plugin
built twice, `lib64/libXrdClUCache-5.so` and `lib64/libXrdClUCache-6.so`, under
`~/.local`. On EL9 `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH` by default; if `ucache` is
not found, add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to your shell startup
file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, …). Any other prefix works too — nothing
cares where the files live. Continue with §2 (activation — one config
file). The tarball and an EL9 RPM are attached to every release on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/xrootd/xrd-ucache/releases).

No XRootD needs to be installed for it: the plugin runs inside a process that
already has an XRootD client (CMSSW, LCG/CVMFS ROOT, EPEL's `xrootd-client`, …)
and uses that one. A compiled plugin serves one XRootD major, so there are two:
`libXrdClUCache-5.so` for XRootD **5.6** and later 5.x clients,
`libXrdClUCache-6.so` for XRootD **6**. Your configuration names
`libXrdClUCache.so`, and each client opens the build for its own major beside
it. The plugin never links ROOT, and where it can't load (CentOS 7-era releases
under apptainer) it fails open — the job just runs uncached.

### Get the source

All three routes below build the same tree, and their `cmake -S .` means this
directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xrootd/xrd-ucache.git
cd xrd-ucache
git checkout v<version>     # optional — a release rather than the tip of main
```

A source tarball from the [Releases
page](https://github.com/xrootd/xrd-ucache/releases) works the same way:
unpack it and `cd` into it instead. Downloading either with `git` or `curl`
matters on macOS — see that section.

### Build from source — AlmaLinux 9 / RHEL 9

Install the toolchain and the XRootD **client** headers. `xrootd*` comes from
EPEL, so enable it first. None of this needs to be the same machine that later
runs your jobs — it just needs the headers to build against.

```sh
sudo dnf -y install epel-release
sudo dnf -y install gcc-c++ cmake make \
     xrootd-client xrootd-client-devel \
     xz-devel zlib-devel libzstd-devel lz4-devel     # codec libs (see note)
```

- `xrootd-client-devel` provides `libXrdCl` + headers (must be ≥ 5.6; EPEL 9
  ships 5.6+). Its headers live under `/usr/include/xrootd`, which is why the
  build needs `-DUCACHE_XROOTD_ROOT=/usr` below.
- The four `*-devel` codec packages are only needed for the **recompression**
  feature (`ucache recompress`, see §Configuration). Omit them
  and everything else still builds — the page cache works fully; the replica
  tier is simply skipped (fail-open at build time). `lz4-devel` is optional even
  among those (it only lets the transposer *read* LZ4-compressed inputs).

Build against the **host** XRootD (point the version pin at `/usr`) and install
to a user prefix — no root needed for the build/install itself:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DUCACHE_BUILD_BENCH=OFF -DUCACHE_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
      -DUCACHE_XROOTD_ROOT=/usr
cmake --build build -j"$(nproc)"
cmake --install build --prefix ~/.local        # or a system prefix (needs write access)
```

`configure` prints `ucache: XRootD client <version> (>= 5.6 required) — OK`; if
it instead can't find `XrdCl/XrdClPlugInInterface.hh`, `xrootd-client-devel`
isn't installed or `-DUCACHE_XROOTD_ROOT` doesn't point at its prefix. This
installs the plugin as `lib64/libXrdClUCache-<major>.so`, named after the
XRootD major it was built against (`-5` for EPEL's client), and the `ucache`
CLI to `bin/`. Put the prefix's `bin` on your `PATH` if it isn't already. To
build for both majors, as the release packages are, add
`-DUCACHE_XROOTD_EXTRA_ROOT=<prefix>` naming a client install of the other
major.

> **Note:** `-DUCACHE_XROOTD_ROOT=/usr` is required on a stock EL9 box — the
> default points at the CERN CVMFS/LCG build used for development, which a
> normal host does not have. Set it to wherever `xrootd-client-devel` landed
> (`$(dirname "$(dirname "$(command -v xrdcp)")")` resolves it).

### Other distributions

The only distro-specific part is the XRootD client package; the rest is the same
`cmake` invocation with `-DUCACHE_XROOTD_ROOT` pointed at its prefix (usually
`/usr`). On Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install g++ cmake make xrootd-dev
liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libzstd-dev liblz4-dev` (verify `xrootd-dev` ≥ 5.6). Any
Linux with a C++17 compiler, CMake ≥ 3.20, and XRootD client ≥ 5.6 works.

### Build from source — macOS

There is no prebuilt macOS package yet. Tested on Apple silicon, macOS 14, with
MacPorts.

**1. Prerequisites.** Command Line Tools are enough — Xcode is not required.

```sh
xcode-select --install                     # clang, linker, SDK
sudo port install cmake xrootd root6 +xrootd
sudo port install xz zstd lz4              # codec libs — recompression only, optional
```

**2. Check which XRootD client your ROOT loads**, and build against that one —
this matters more on macOS than anywhere else, because a second XRootD
(Homebrew's, or a ROOT framework build) makes the plugin load and never cache:

```sh
root-config --has-xrootd                                       # must say yes
otool -L "$(root-config --libdir)/libNetxNG.so" | grep -i XrdCl
```

The prefix flags below assume that path is under `/opt/local`; point them
elsewhere if it is not.

> **MacPorts installs ROOT's tools with a `6` suffix** — `root6`,
> `root-config6`. Substitute `root-config6` in the two commands above.
> `sudo port select --set root root6` is meant to create the unsuffixed names
> and fails on ROOT 6.40, because its list still names the removed `proofserv`.

> uCache does not need ROOT to build — `root-config` comes with ROOT, and this
> step only identifies the client that will load the plugin at run time. Skip
> it if ROOT is not installed yet or you read with uproot; with only MacPorts'
> `xrootd` present, `/opt/local` is the answer. Run it later against whatever
> ends up loading the plugin, and rebuild if it names a different XrdCl.

**3. Get the source** — the `git clone` under "Get the source" above. `-S .`
below is that directory.

**4. Build and install.**

```sh
export TMPDIR=/tmp          # do this FIRST — see the note below
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DUCACHE_BUILD_BENCH=OFF -DUCACHE_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
      -DUCACHE_XROOTD_ROOT=/opt/local -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/local
cmake --build build -j"$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)"
cmake --install build --prefix ~/.local
```

**5. Check what you built.**

```sh
~/.local/bin/ucache --version
otool -L ~/.local/lib/libXrdClUCache-*.so | grep -i XrdCl   # same path as step 2
```

The **second** line of that output is the one to read — the `libXrdCl` the
plugin will load, which must be the path step 2 printed. The first line is the
library naming itself, and its `compatibility version 0.0.0` is not a version
of anything: the plugin is `dlopen`ed by absolute path, so it carries no
Mach-O dylib version. The version XRootD checks at load is separate, and is
the client release the plugin was compiled against:

```sh
strings ~/.local/lib/libXrdClUCache-*.so | grep '@V:'   # e.g. @V:XrdClUCache v5.9.1
```

It must be the same major as the client that loads the plugin and no newer
than it; building against that same client, as above, satisfies it by
construction. The file is named after that major: `libXrdClUCache-5.so` with
MacPorts' XRootD 5, `libXrdClUCache-6.so` with Homebrew's or conda's XRootD 6.

> **Set `TMPDIR` before building.** With it unset, the compiler is handed a
> per-session `/var/folders/...` path it may not own, and AppleClang then fails to
> compile anything at all with "unable to make temporary file". Any writable
> directory works.

> **If both MacPorts and Homebrew are present**, CMake searches `/opt/homebrew`
> first on Apple silicon. The two prefix flags above are what keep the build on
> the same XrdCl your ROOT loads — confirm with `otool -L` rather than assuming.

> **On quarantine.** Gatekeeper's `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is applied by
> the application that downloads a file — a browser, Mail — and a quarantined
> library cannot be `dlopen`ed, so the XRootD client would silently decline to
> load a plugin obtained that way. `git`, `curl` and `tar` do not set it, so
> fetching the source as above is unaffected.

Everything after this is identical to Linux: activate with the same plugin
configuration file (§2), and point the cache at an ordinary directory on a
volume with room to spare.

### For site administrators (optional)

Each release also ships `xrd-ucache-<version>-1.el9.x86_64.rpm` for a system-wide
install (`dnf install`, lands in `/usr/lib64` + `/usr/bin`). It requires no
XRootD package: the plugin uses whichever client a job runs, from the system
or from CVMFS. Nothing about uCache *needs* this — it exists for admins
who want one shared copy; users still activate per-user (§2). Maintainers:
`scripts/package-el9.sh` builds both artifacts into `dist/` with the host
toolchain (never an LCG shell), so they run on stock EL9 and inside CMSSW/LCG
environments alike.

## 2. Activate (one file, no root)

uCache is activated **and** configured by a single file: an XRootD plugin
config that tells XrdCl to load the plugin and carries all ucache settings —
starting with where the cache lives. Write it yourself, or let `ucache setup`
write the same file; nothing else is touched either way.

### Write the file

XrdCl scans `~/.xrootd/client.plugins.d/` automatically in every `root://`
process — no environment variable, no shell startup file to edit, no shell
to reload, and batch jobs pick it up too. The package ships the recommended
file, which activates nothing until you copy it into your own account (uCache
is a per-user cache; nothing it installs switches it on for anyone else):

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.xrootd/client.plugins.d
cp /usr/share/xrd-ucache/ucache.conf ~/.xrootd/client.plugins.d/   # the RPM
# a tarball or source install: <prefix>/share/xrd-ucache/ucache.conf
# then edit it: set `dir` (required); unless you installed the RPM, also `lib`
ucache doctor      # verify install, filesystem, activation; exits 0 when good
```

The file, without its longer comments:

```ini
url = *
lib = /usr/lib64/libXrdClUCache.so
enable = true

# REQUIRED: the cache directory, on a LOCAL disk (not AFS, NFS or EOS).
dir = /path/on/a/local/disk/ucache

# Recompression is OFF by default: the cache keeps the bytes the origin sent.
# With it on, a ROOT file read for the first time is converted, as it is read,
# into a form that is faster to decode -- no separate step.
#
# MEMORY: with it on, a job holds more memory while it reads. On the analyses
# measured, warm passes needed about 1.8x (TTree) and 2.3x (RNTuple) the memory
# the same job needs from a replica made by `ucache recompress`. If your jobs
# run short of memory, leave it off and build replicas with `ucache recompress`
# instead. Turning it off later does not change files already recompressed
# this way: remove those first, while no job is reading them (`ucache
# untranspose <url>`, or `ucache clear`; a job still reading one would fail).
# recompress = on
```

- `dir` — where the cached data lives. **Required, on purpose**: there is no
  default location (a default would silently land in your home directory,
  which on CERN machines is AFS — caching network data onto a network
  filesystem defeats the purpose). Use a **local** disk. Until it is set,
  `doctor` FAILs and the plugin runs uncached (fail-open).
- `lib` — the absolute path to wherever §1 put the plugin:
  `/usr/lib64/libXrdClUCache.so` from the RPM (as shipped), or
  `$HOME/.local/lib64/libXrdClUCache.so` for the no-root tarball/source
  install — written out in full: the conf needs a literal absolute path, no
  `~` and no `$HOME`. No file has exactly that name: an XRootD client adds its
  own major and opens `libXrdClUCache-5.so` or `libXrdClUCache-6.so` beside
  it, so one line serves both. Name the plain file, not one of the builds —
  naming one makes every client load it, and a client of the other major then
  refuses it. `ucache doctor` prints the file your client opens on its
  `plugin loads` line, and `ucache setup` (below) fills the path in for you.
- `url = *` intercepts every `root://` URL. If a system config in
  `/etc/xrootd/client.plugins.d/` already claims the `*` slot (`doctor`
  warns), list your data hosts explicitly instead:
  `url = eospublic.cern.ch:1094;xrootd.example.org:1094` (your experiment's
  data servers or redirectors).
- XrdCl resolves the `~` in `~/.xrootd/client.plugins.d` from the passwd
  database, not `$HOME` — they differ on some batch systems.
- Prefer the file elsewhere? XrdCl also processes `$XRD_PLUGINCONFDIR`
  (after `/etc/xrootd/client.plugins.d` and the default dir — last wins for
  the same `url`), so you can keep the conf in any directory and set that
  variable in your shell startup file; that route only works in shells (and
  jobs) where the variable is set.

Deactivation is equally boring: delete the file (or set `enable = false`).

However you configured things — this file, `XRD_PLUGINCONFDIR`, `XRD_PLUGIN`,
environment variables, `setup` — **`ucache doctor` is the one verification
step**: it finds the governing conf exactly as XrdCl would, dlopens the very
file your client would open for the library that conf names, checks the cache
filesystem, and exits nonzero if anything would stop caching (no conf,
`enable = false`, a shadowed `url = *`, a stale `lib =` path, no build for
your client's XRootD major, an unset or unsuitable cache dir).

### Or: no file at all (`XRD_PLUGIN`)

Two environment variables switch uCache on with every default:

```sh
export XRD_PLUGIN=/usr/lib64/libXrdClUCache.so   # the RPM; else <prefix>/lib64/libXrdClUCache.so
export UCACHE_DIR=/path/on/a/local/disk/ucache   # required: there is no default
ucache doctor
```

`XRD_PLUGIN` is XRootD's own variable: every client loads the library it
names, for every URL, and reads no plugin configuration at all. Settings then
come from `UCACHE_*` variables and `ucache set` (§Configuration). Three things
follow from how it works:

- **No plugin config file is read while it is set** — not yours, not the
  system's. Any other client plugin configured on the machine is off in that
  process, and a `ucache.conf`'s settings, `dir` included, do not apply
  (`doctor` says so if you have one).
- **It applies to every URL on every host.** A config file can limit uCache to
  some hosts; this cannot.
- **Every process that reads data needs both variables**, batch jobs
  included: export them in the job script.

To switch it off, unset `XRD_PLUGIN`.

### Or: `ucache setup` (writes the same file)

```sh
ucache setup --host eospublic.cern.ch:1094 --dir /data/$USER/ucache-cache
ucache doctor
```

`setup` writes exactly the file above — the same text, with this install's
plugin path, your `--host` and your `--dir` filled in — to
`~/.xrootd/client.plugins.d/ucache.conf`, and touches nothing
else: no shell startup files, no environment variables, no second config.
`--dir` is required unless `UCACHE_DIR` or an existing conf already provides
a location (there is deliberately no default). Activation is immediate for
every `root://` process, batch jobs included.

## 3. Verify it really works, then run your analysis

**The standard self-test** — point it at any file your conf intercepts
(pick one of your usual data files; the whole file is transferred, so not
your biggest):

```sh
ucache test root://<your-host>//path/to/file.root
```

It uses your setup exactly as configured — no changes, no environment — and
runs a cold pass then a warm pass through a real XRootD client, with
progress shown. It PASSes only if the warm pass is served entirely from
cache with **zero origin contact**, then removes the entry it created (a
file that was already cached is verified warm-only and kept). Exit 0 = the
whole chain works: conf → plugin loaded → interception → caching → warm
serving. It tests the byte cache: its copies run with copy detection off,
because uCache otherwise reads a copy straight from the origin (below) and the
test would see no cache traffic at all, with `max_read_fraction` at 100, since
a copy reads all of a file, and with recompression's layout
switched off, because a whole-file copy of a file in that layout would read
baskets the layout never keeps.

Then run your normal ROOT / RDataFrame / uproot job **twice**:

```sh
python my_analysis.py     # cold: fetches the working set from the origin
python my_analysis.py     # warm: served from local cache
ucache stats              # warm pass shows origin_bytes == 0
```

(Don't smoke-test with plain `xrdcp`: a copy never uses the cache — it is
read straight from the origin, so `stats` shows only `copier_handles` and
direct bytes. Use `ucache test`, or, to push one copy through the byte cache,
`UCACHE_COPY_DETECT=off UCACHE_MAX_READ_FRACTION=100 XRD_CPUSEPGWRTRD=0 xrdcp …`
— the second setting because a copy reads all of a file, which a ROOT file is
otherwise not cached for (see `max_read_fraction`), the third because xrdcp
otherwise transfers with PgRead, which the cache passes through.)

`ucache status` shows where the cache lives, the disk budget, how much is cached,
and aggregate counters.

## Monitoring — start with `ucache summary`

`ucache summary` answers the question you actually have: **is this cache worth
having, and what has it saved me?** It reads records the plugin already wrote —
nothing needs to be running, and there is no sampling daemon to start.

```text
$ ucache summary
overall    : 12 run(s) recorded — 336.8 GB read, 86.3 GB from the origin
  saved    : 10m43s — 4 run(s) took 4m49s, and would have taken about 15m32s with
             no cache (3.2x, vs a measured baseline)
  health   : OK — no faults in any recorded run

by dataset
  3fe77e    439 files      623.9 GB at origin   47 dir(s)  eospublic.cern.ch
           4 run(s), 2 measured (71% of GB)   108.5 GB read   gain  byte 1.96x  repl 5.07x
  34a731    255 files      630.8 GB at origin   10 dir(s)  eospublic.cern.ch
           4 run(s), 2 measured (67% of GB)   105.8 GB read   gain  byte 3.67x  repl 4.56x

cache      : /scratch/ucache — 694 entries, 202.8 GB on disk (61.4 byte + 141.4 replica),
             1.3 TB headroom

notes
  8 of 12 runs not measured:  3 baseline(s) — they are the reference  3 filled the cache  2 under 30s
next       : `ucache summary --detail` for the last run; `ucache history` for the trend
publish    : `ucache publish` — a report with recommendations from this history;
             paths, hostnames and file names never leave the machine (docs/PUBLISH.md)
```

Runs are grouped by the set of files they read, so a cache used for more than
one analysis does not average them into a single meaningless number. The
`notes` block accounts for every run that produced no gain, by reason — a run
that IS the reference, one that filled the cache, one too short to time — so
"not measured" is never left looking like "measured and disappointing".

**The headline is time, and it is measured against a baseline — the same work
run once with the cache out of the loop.** Record one by running your job with
`UCACHE_DISABLE=1` set; the plugin passes everything through untouched and
writes the run down like any other. From then on, cached runs over the same
files are compared against it — and the comparison is symmetric: **a cache that
is slower than your origin shows up as a cost, not a gain**:

```text
overall    : 7 run(s) recorded — 429.4 GiB served from cache, 222.8 GiB from the origin
  COST     : the cache is costing you time on this workload — 4 run(s) took 15m26s
             where no cache would have taken about 11m40s (0.8x, vs a measured baseline)
```

That is a real result from a real workload (a fast LAN origin and cheaply
compressed data): the honest answer there is to not use a cache, and the tool
says so.

### Why a baseline, and not an estimate

Nothing recorded during cached operation can stand in for the origin alone —
this was measured, twice, before being accepted. The cold fill's wall is set
partly by the cache's own writes (on the workload above, using it as the
reference reported a 1.7x *gain* where the measured truth was a 0.70x *loss*),
and service-time histograms record blocked waits, which overlap compute and are
not wall time (same test: 2.8x, same truth). A measured baseline reproduces the
true ratio to about 1% either way. One extra run of your job is what
truthfulness costs.

**Two kinds of run can be the reference.** One with the cache switched off, and
a first pass over data the cache does not have yet — a *fill* — provided the
cache added little to it: the origin has to have delivered at least 90% of the
bytes (80%, when a correction is possible, below), and the cache's own writing
must have cost no more than a tenth of the time spent waiting on the origin.

Even a first pass over an empty cache is served some of its data from it: every
piece of a file a thread opens re-reads the file's header and table of
contents, and after the first time those come from what the pass has just
fetched — 5-10% of the bytes on a multi-threaded job. That makes a fill a
little faster than a run with the cache off, so gains measured against it read
a little low. When a warm run over the same files, served from the byte cache,
exists, the fill's time is corrected for it: a fill that took T with a share f
from the cache, beside a warm run that took T_warm, counts as
(T − f·T_warm) / (1 − f). `ucache summary --detail` says when a reference was
corrected, and by what share. That second figure is a coarse estimate, not
a percentage of your job: it compares time blocked writing against time blocked
fetching, and both are summed across threads, so it can be off by a factor of
two or three in either direction. It is used only to tell a 1-2% effect from a
20%+ one, which is all the admission decision needs. That second kind of
reference means an ordinary first run can supply a
measurement without anyone having known to record one. A switched-off run still
wins over a fill however recent the fill is, because a fill carries
its own writing in its wall.

Rules the comparison enforces, so a number is never printed where it would
mislead:

- **Same files.** The baseline must cover ≥70% of the same files in both
  directions, matched by URL.
- **Same work.** Covering the same files is not enough — two analyses can read
  the same files and touch quite different parts of them. Each run records
  which 1 MiB blocks of each file it read, in the original file's coordinates,
  and at least **90% of the files compared must agree**. It is a share and not
  a single hash over the whole run because the two routes genuinely differ a
  little: a replica is a rewritten container and the reader asks it for
  different spans, which on a measured file set left 26 files of 439 disagreeing
  on otherwise identical work.
- **Enough evidence to check.** At least half the compared files must carry
  that record on both sides for the comparison to count as VERIFIED. One
  agreeing file cannot vouch for four hundred. Below that line the walls are
  still compared — absence of evidence is not evidence of different work, and
  refusing here made the answer depend on how much evidence happened to exist,
  so that adding one signature to one file could delete a measurement that
  worked with none. What changes is that the result says so:
  `ucache summary --detail` prints `same work: NOT verified` with the count it
  rests on, and both JSON readouts carry `work_verified`.
- **Big enough, long enough, clean.** Runs and baselines under 30 s or 64 MiB
  are refused (too short to time at one-second resolution), and a run that hit
  faults is not used as one.
- A run that mostly *filled* the cache is never given a gain of its own.

Recording a baseline *after* you have been running cached for a while works
fine — either side in time qualifies. When the answer cannot be sound,
`summary` says why, and which of these it was, instead of printing a number.

`ucache summary --detail` adds the last run underneath: tier split, delivered
rate, per-tier read counts and sizes, replica coverage, and that run's own
comparison with its baseline.

## Trend across runs — `ucache history`

One row per run, newest first. This is where you see whether the numbers hold up
over time, across versions, or after you change the cache disk.

publish    : `ucache publish` — a report with recommendations from this history;
             paths, hostnames and file names never leave the machine (docs/PUBLISH.md)
```

Reading it: two datasets, kept apart. In the lower group the two `base` rows are
the references — the bottom one ran with the cache switched off, the one above
it is a fill that qualified — and the same work served warm reads 1.96x from the
byte tier and 5.07x from recompressed replicas. The upper group has references
too, but both of its warm runs are under the 30-second floor, so they report `-`
rather than a number from too short a wall.

- `SIG` is the set of files; `RSIG` is which parts of them were read. Rows
  sharing both did the same work. They are not a gate on their own — whether
  two runs may be compared is settled file by file, at 90% — but a row whose
  `RSIG` differs from its baseline's is worth looking at before trusting the
  number beside it.
- `DIR/FILL/BYTE/REPL` is where the bytes came from, as percentages: straight
  from the origin without caching, fetched and kept, served from the byte
  cache, served from a recompressed replica.
- `PEAK cor` is the width actually measured — CPU-seconds per wall-second,
  sampled on the read path — not a thread count. `RIF orig` is the most reads
  the origin was being asked for at once. Both read `-` on records written
  before they existed, as above; a run recorded by a current build shows a
  number, and for `RIF` on a warm run that number is 0, correctly, because
  nothing went to the origin.
- `INS`/`IPS` are instructions retired and per second: the same analysis
  executes very nearly the same instruction count however the bytes reached it,
  so a row far off its neighbours did different work whatever else agrees.
  `OVH` is what the cache's own writing cost as a share of the origin wait, and
  is what decides whether a fill can be a reference.
- `GAIN` reads `base` for a reference run and `-` where the comparison was
  refused; `ucache summary` says why.

`RATE` is what the job consumed from all sources combined — paced by the
application, not a cache capability (that is `ucache bench`). A process that
opened no file and read nothing is left out — of this table and of what
`summary` calls the last run: a `ucache` command, or a parent process that only
started the workers that did the reading. Every process that read is listed,
however short (one under 30 s gets no gain: it is too short to time), and so is
a worker that ended without closing its files. `--top N` shows more rows;
`--json` on either command emits the same figures for scripting.

Records appear when a job that used the cache **exits**; CLI invocations do not
write them. `ucache stats --reset` starts a fresh counter window but keeps the
run history (moved under `stats/history/`, where both commands still read it) —
baselines survive a reset.

## A report with recommendations — `ucache publish`

`summary` and `history` tell you what happened; the report service tells you
what it means: how this disk grades against reference thresholds, how it
compares with your own origin measurement, and what to change. One command,
foreground, nothing automatic:

```sh
ucache publish              # asks for confirmation, prints the report URL
ucache publish --dry-run    # shows the exact payload and sends nothing
```

What goes out is the run history, the disk's benchmark records and this
machine's origin measurements — as numbers — and the time this machine takes
for a fixed CPU workload, measured at every publish (it takes about a second).
Paths, mount points and the hostname are replaced by salted hashes whose salt
never leaves the machine; file names never leave and origin URLs are reduced to
domains; run timestamps to dates. Every
field is listed in **`docs/PUBLISH.md`**, and the report URLs are unlisted:
whoever has one can read that page and nobody else can. `ucache bench
--publish` and `ucache netbench --publish` send a single record the same way.

## Monitoring — reading `ucache stats`

`ucache stats` aggregates the counters every process wrote and prints four
blocks. Run it after a job to see what the cache actually did. An example from
a warm pass:

```text
stats across 3 process file(s):
  opens              1574
  hit_bytes          58720256000 (54.7 GiB)
  miss_bytes         0 (0 B)
  origin_bytes       0 (0 B)
  ...
  crc_failures       0
  failopen_events    0
  admissions_bypassed 0
workflow:
  files opened       787 distinct (2.0 opens/file)
  served by tier     direct 0 B | fill 0 B | ram 1.2 GiB | disk 53.5 GiB | replica 0 B
  hit disk reads     2380995 (mean 41.8 KiB, 88% sequential)
  re-read factor     1.8x (first touch 30.4 GiB of 54.7 GiB byte-tier serves)
  fill flushes       4210 runs (mean 7.9 MiB)
read size p50/p95/p99 (log2 buckets, floor):
  requested          4.0 KiB / 64.0 KiB / 256.0 KiB
  byte-tier pread    32.0 KiB / 128.0 KiB / 512.0 KiB
latency p50/p95/p99:
  hit read           48us / 210us / 1.4ms
  origin rt          -
```

The first block is raw totals. `workflow:` is the arithmetic you would
otherwise do by hand — which tier served the bytes, how often each file was
opened, how much of the reading was re-reading. The last two blocks describe
what the storage was asked for and how long it took; `-` means there were no
samples, so `origin rt -` above is the point of a warm pass, not a gap.

### The four questions worth asking

1. **Did the cache engage at all?** On a warm pass `origin_bytes` should be
   **0** — every byte came from local disk. If it is large, or `relay_bytes`
   dominates, the cache is being bypassed rather than used; `ucache doctor`
   and the activation section above are where to look.
2. **Is anything wrong?** `crc_failures`, `failopen_events` and
   `validations_failed` should **all be 0**. They are separate on purpose:
   a CRC failure quarantines a page, a fail-open event means the cache
   degraded to pass-through, and a validation failure means an entry was
   discarded as stale.
3. **Is the cache big enough?** A non-zero `admissions_bypassed` means files
   were left uncached because everything resident was still in use — reads
   succeeded, uncached. Together with a large `evicted_bytes` it says the
   working set does not fit; `ucache status` names the remedy.
4. **Is the cache disk keeping up?** `fill stalls` is time a job spent waiting
   on the cache disk, and the `hit read` latency percentiles show what reads
   cost. If those are slow, measure the disk itself with
   `ucache bench <dir>` — a cache on the wrong device can be slower than the
   origin.

### Other forms

```sh
ucache stats --files --top 20   # per-file records, costliest first
ucache stats --reset            # start a fresh measurement window (records are kept)
```

`--reset` warns if a job looks like it is still running, since its counters
would vanish with the files.

Every field, and the JSON schema tooling reads, is in [Metrics](STATS.md).

## How it works (briefly)

**Read-ahead (off by default; `ucache set prefetch on`).** A ROOT reader
fetches a batch of baskets, works on it, then fetches the next; on a cold pass
it waits for the origin every time. uCache reads the tree's own metadata — where every basket of every
branch is and which entry it starts at — identifies the branches your job
uses from what it asks for, and fetches the next stretch while your code is
still computing on the current one. The prediction is checked before anything
is fetched (the first prediction is only compared with the next real request),
what is fetched is bounded by what your job has been drawing per request, and
a process that finds a quarter of its read-ahead unused switches it off. A
page fetched ahead reaches the cache only once your job has actually asked
for it; anything never asked for is dropped from RAM. Read-ahead never opens a
connection of its own: if your job is being served entirely from the cache, it
stays that way. Readers that fetch once per file open (one task per chunk)
never confirm a prediction, so they cost no origin traffic. `UCACHE_PREFETCH=on`
turns it on for one job; the `prefetch_*` counters in `ucache stats` show what
it did.

**When it is worth switching on.** It returns time your job spends waiting for
the origin, so it helps exactly where that wait is a large share of the run
and nowhere else. On the workload it is best measured on — a full analysis
over 1453 TTree files from a CERN-LAN origin at 32 threads, first pass — it
reads **about 1.2x faster for roughly 1% more origin traffic**. On a warm pass
it does nothing by design. It is largest when the time your job spends
fetching and the time it spends decompressing are about equal, and it falls
away in both directions: on a much slower origin you are bandwidth-bound and
the cache itself is what helps, and on a much faster one there was little wait
to remove. It is off by default because that gain is real but narrow, and
nobody should acquire a new moving part in their read path without choosing
it.

- **Page cache, not file cache.** uCache stores the pages your analysis
  actually reads (4 KiB each, 16 KiB on macOS), typically a small fraction of
  each file, each protected by a CRC32C. It never stores data it wasn't asked
  for beyond page rounding.
- **Validation.** A cached entry is trusted for a freshness window (default
  7 days): inside it, opens don't contact the origin at all — warm passes work
  even when the remote is down or flaky. When the window expires, the next
  open re-checks the origin file's size (and, with
  `UCACHE_VALIDATE=size+mtime`, its mtime); a changed file is re-cached. Set
  `revalidate_seconds = 0` to re-check on every open.
- **Fail-open.** Every failure path degrades to a normal uncached read.
- **Many processes, one cache.** Processes started separately, and workers a
  process forks after it has read through the cache (Python's `multiprocessing`
  and `concurrent.futures` process pools, ROOT's `TProcessExecutor`), fill and
  read the same cache; each keeps its own counters in `ucache stats`. A worker
  reading through a file its parent opened sees the file as the parent was
  shown it, or, if that layout was removed since and cannot be had again, gets
  an error on every read of that file handle (opening the file again works).

## Configuration

Three levels, lowest to highest, each with its own job:

1. **Your defaults** — `key = value` lines in the same `ucache.conf` that
   activates the plugin (§2), next to `url`/`lib`/`enable`. Edited by hand,
   by you; no `ucache` command ever writes this file.
2. **Current values** — set from the CLI without touching your defaults:
   `ucache set <key> <value>` / `ucache unset <key>` (kept in a small state
   file inside the cache dir; applies to processes started from then on,
   persists until unset).
3. **Per-job override** — the `UCACHE_*` environment variable twins, for one
   run: `UCACHE_REVALIDATE_S=0 ./my_job`.

`ucache settings` prints every knob with its effective value **and where it
came from** (default | conf | state | env); `doctor` flags any CLI-set values
overriding your defaults. Common keys:

| ucache.conf         | env                     | meaning |
|---------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| `dir = …`           | `UCACHE_DIR`            | cache location — **required** (no default; use a local disk). Unset ⇒ doctor FAILs, plugin runs uncached |
| `max_bytes = 50g`   | `UCACHE_MAX_BYTES`      | hard cache-size cap; unset ⇒ no cap (use the disk, evict at the floor) |
| `min_free_bytes = …`| `UCACHE_MIN_FREE_BYTES` | keep this much disk free (the default limit) |
| `in_use_seconds = 86400` | `UCACHE_IN_USE_S` | how long after a reader last used a file it stays in use: not evicted (read, or its maps handed out, this recently), and a replaced map keeps its place for readers that still hold it (default 1 day; 0 = plain LRU, and a replaced map stays valid only while an open handle holds it). Replaces `evict_protect_seconds` and `map_expiry_seconds` |
| `validate = size`   | `UCACHE_VALIDATE`       | `none` / `size` / `size+mtime` / `cksum`. **Caveat:** the plugin has no origin-checksum source yet, so `cksum` currently degrades to size-only (weaker than `size+mtime`) — prefer `size+mtime` until a checksum query lands |
| `revalidate_seconds = 604800` | `UCACHE_REVALIDATE_S` | freshness window (TTL): an entry validated against the origin within this many seconds is served with **no remote contact at all**. Default 7 days — right for write-once physics data. `0` = re-check on every open; `ucache rm <url>` forces a re-check anytime |
| `open_retries = 0`  | `UCACHE_OPEN_RETRIES`   | retry a transient open failure this many times (0 = off); backoff via `open_retry_base_ms`/`open_retry_max_ms` |
| `recompress = off`  | `UCACHE_RECOMPRESS`     | `on` = the files your jobs read get fast-to-decode replicas **automatically**, created on their first pass (default off — opt-in CPU/disk). Flip it with `ucache set recompress on` |
| `recompress_keep_originals = off` | `UCACHE_RECOMPRESS_KEEP_ORIGINALS` | `on` = when baskets are converted into a replica, keep their original bytes in the byte cache too (by default they are not kept, and a copy held from before is released: the cache would hold the same data twice) |
| `mixed_maps = on` | `UCACHE_MIXED_MAPS` | with `recompress = on`: each open of a TTree file is shown its newest map, the baskets converted by then back to back at their real size (see "Recompression"); `off` = every open sees the first-pass layout, every basket at the size of its room — for jobs that hand basket positions to workers on other machines with caches of their own |
| `recompress_codecs = lzma,zlib` | `UCACHE_RECOMPRESS_CODECS` | which **source** codecs are worth recompressing (comma list); branches in other codecs are served as-is |
| `recompress_reclaim = superseded` | `UCACHE_RECOMPRESS_RECLAIM` | what to free from the byte cache once a file's replica exists: `superseded` (default) punches only the ranges the replica replaced; `full` drops the **entire** byte copy — replicas become the primary copy, uncovered reads refetch from origin (space-tight disks) |
| `page_size = 4k` | `UCACHE_PAGE_SIZE` | size of the pages the cache stores: 4 KiB, and 16 KiB on macOS, where a smaller page written into a hole of the cache file takes 16 KiB of disk anyway. Applies to files cached from then on. `ucache doctor` checks it against the cache disk |
| `log = warn` | `UCACHE_LOG` | `error` / `warn` / `info` / `debug`, optionally `:/path/to/file`. The XRootD client's own switch works too: `XRD_LOGLEVEL=Debug` shows uCache's debug messages, and with `XRD_LOGFILE` they go into the client's log file under the topic `UCache`. `ucache set log debug` turns debug on for every job; `ucache unset log` turns it off |
| `trace = off` | `UCACHE_TRACE` | `io` = write a sampled per-operation JSON trace next to the process's stats file (deep-dive forensics; zero cost when off). Best set per job: `UCACHE_TRACE=io python3 my_analysis.py` |
| `trace_sample = 64` | `UCACHE_TRACE_SAMPLE` | record every Nth read-class trace op (`1` = everything; opens/flushes are always recorded) |
| `prefetch = off`    | `UCACHE_PREFETCH`       | read ahead for TTree readers: the next batch of baskets is predicted from the file's own metadata and fetched while your code computes (default **off**; see below). `on` = try to stay a batch ahead of your code |
| `prefetch_window_mb = 32` | `UCACHE_PREFETCH_WINDOW_MB` | how far ahead one file handle may read (one fill's worth per branch, up to this) |
| `prefetch_ram_mb = 1024` | `UCACHE_PREFETCH_RAM_MB` | RAM the whole process may hold in read-ahead pages not yet asked for, counting both what has arrived and what is on the wire; the window shrinks as it is approached and reaches zero at the limit. With many reader threads this, not the window, is what sizes how far ahead each one gets |
| `prefetch_depth = 1` | `UCACHE_PREFETCH_DEPTH` | how many batches ahead to keep fetching. Measured and left at one: a second batch queued behind the first does not arrive any sooner (an origin answers one open file's requests one at a time) and guessing further ahead is less accurate, so on a full pass depth 2 fetched 6.6% more and read 6% slower. Raise it only for an origin that overlaps one file's requests |
| `prefetch_bridge_kb = 0` | `UCACHE_PREFETCH_BRIDGE_KB` | join predicted ranges separated by less than this into one request element. Off, and measured to be a bad trade on a busy origin: it fetches more bytes to save request pieces, and once several readers share a link the bytes cost far more than the pieces save. The extra bytes are thrown away on arrival and never enter the cache |
| `prefetch_map_cache_mb = 256` | `UCACHE_PREFETCH_MAP_CACHE_MB` | RAM for parsed basket maps, shared by every reader thread. One map of a 1500-branch file is about 21 MB, and a map dropped before it is used has to be parsed again |
| `prefetch_join = on` | `UCACHE_PREFETCH_JOIN` | when your job asks for bytes read-ahead is already fetching, wait for that copy instead of asking the origin a second time. `off` restores the older behaviour, which fetched them twice |
| `prefetch_threads = 4` | `UCACHE_PREFETCH_THREADS` | threads predicting and reading basket maps. One cannot both parse a new file's map and keep up with the batches of many reader threads |
| `announce = on`     | `UCACHE_ANNOUNCE`       | name uCache as the application in what the client tells servers at login, so a site can see traffic that comes through a cache (default on; see below). `off` = send your program's own name, as without uCache |
| `copy_detect = on`  | `UCACHE_COPY_DETECT`    | copy tools and copy engines read straight from the origin, so a copy is the origin's bytes (default on; see below). `off` = they are ordinary readers and use the cache |
| `max_read_fraction = 25` | `UCACHE_MAX_READ_FRACTION` | a job whose reads of a ROOT file (a TTree or RNTuple of 64 MiB or more) cover branches holding more than this percentage of the file's data reads that file straight from the origin and caches none of its data (see below). `100` = cache every file |
| `disable = true`    | `UCACHE_DISABLE`        | turn caching off (pure pass-through) |

Sizes accept `k`/`m`/`g`/`t` suffixes.

**Put the cache on local disk.** `dir` has **no default** — an unset cache
location is a loud condition (`doctor` FAILs, the plugin passes through
uncached), never a silent cache in your home directory, which on CERN
machines is AFS/NFS. Point it at a local filesystem (`/data/$USER/…`, local
scratch, `/tmp/$USER/…`); `doctor`'s sparse-files WARN flags network
filesystems that slipped through.

**Reliable reads under a flaky/loaded/WAN remote.** This is the default: once
an entry has been validated, reads within the 7-day freshness window are
served **entirely from local disk — the origin is never opened or statted**,
and is contacted only if a genuine cache miss needs new bytes. Repeated
analysis passes are independent of remote state (the origin can be down and
warm reads still complete). Right for write-once physics data; a file changed
in place at the origin isn't noticed until the window lapses — set
`revalidate_seconds = 0` (re-check every open) if that ever matters for yours.

**Reliable opens under a flaky/loaded remote.** Some servers intermittently fail
individual file *opens* under load or over the WAN (a transient error — the same
file opens on retry), and ROOT aborts the whole job on any single open failure, so
a many-file job's success probability collapses with scale. Set
`UCACHE_OPEN_RETRIES` (e.g. `3`) and the plugin retries a *transient* open failure
with exponential full-jitter backoff (`UCACHE_OPEN_RETRY_BASE_MS`=200,
`UCACHE_OPEN_RETRY_MAX_MS`=5000 cap) instead of letting it abort — genuine errors
(missing or forbidden files) still fail fast. This rescues the initial (cold)
fill; `UCACHE_REVALIDATE_S` then carries later warm passes with no remote contact.
Off by default; for a large job over a flaky remote, 2–3 retries makes a transient
per-open failure negligible.

**What a server learns about you.** An XRootD client names itself when it
opens a session: the program doing the reading (`root.exe`, `python3`,
`cmsRun`) and a free-form information string, both carried inside the login
request. With a cache in front, the requests a server actually sees are the
cache's — page-aligned, never asking twice for the same bytes, and absent
altogether on a warm pass — so uCache puts its own name there and keeps your
program beside it:

```
application   ucache
information   ucache/1.0.0 (root.exe)
```

Sites use this to see how much of their traffic already comes through a cache,
which is worth their knowing and costs you nothing: the two strings travel in
the login that opens a session, so nothing is added per file and no extra
request is made, and they are the only thing that changes — what uCache asks
for and how your job behaves are untouched. Nothing about your data, your
paths or your identity is in them; your username and host reach the server
anyway, as they do without uCache.

Turn it off with `announce = off` and your program is named as before. A name
you set yourself always wins: export `XRD_APPNAME` or `XRD_MONINFO` and uCache
leaves that field alone. And uCache stays quiet whenever it is not actually in
the data path — `disable = true`, or no `dir`, or a copy tool (`xrdcp`,
`xrdfs`, `xrdadler32`, `edmCopyUtil`), whose reads are all copies — because
those reads really are your program's own, which also keeps a
`UCACHE_DISABLE=1` baseline run looking like exactly what it is.

**Copies are the origin's bytes.** uCache can show a reader a file in a layout
of its own (a replica, see below): the same data to ROOT, but a different file.
A copy is meant to be the file, so a copy never goes through the cache. These
are recognised and read straight from the origin, and never enter or use the
cache: `xrdcp` (and `xrdcopy`), `xrdfs cat`/`tail`, `xrdadler32`,
`edmCopyUtil`, XRootD's copy engine from any program or language (Python's
`XRootD.client.CopyProcess`, `gfal-copy`, `rucio download`), ROOT's
`TFile::Cp`, and ROOT's own tools that merge, copy or report on files: `hadd`,
the command-line tools (`rootcp`, `rootmv`, `rooteventselector`,
`rootslimtree`, `rootls`, `rootprint`, ...) and `TFileMerger` given a file's
name. Only the copy's own file handle is affected: a program that reads
a file and also copies one keeps its reads cached. A checksum asked for at the
end of a copy (`xrdcp --cksum`, `gfal-copy -K`) is the origin's. Because a copy
reads the origin, it needs the origin to be reachable, even for a file that is
cached.

A file with a replica is also recognised by how it is read. A handle whose
first request reads the whole file at once (fsspec's `open().read()`,
`cat_file(path, 0, size)`) is a copy, and gets the origin's bytes. A handle that
reads the file in pieces up to the size the origin reports, without first
reading any of the replica's own part, is stopped with an error at the piece
that would complete it, naming the remedy: fsspec reading block by block, a loop
sized by the file system's `stat`, whose result would be the first part of the
replica's layout -- not a valid file -- and also fsspec's `get`, which reads
pieces until the end and cannot be told from them at that piece.
`copies_refused` in `ucache stats` counts these.

A copy made any other way reads through the cache like any reader, and for a
file with a replica it copies what it is shown. The whole layout, read in one
request (`cat_file(path, None, None)`, `read_bytes`) or by a loop sized by the
handle's own `stat`, is a valid file but not the origin's. Pieces of one copy
spread over several handles or processes (a download in parallel segments,
workers each copying a part, pieces on a handle an earlier reader in the same
process used) are not seen together, and come out corrupt. The same goes for
fast cloning inside a program of your own (`CloneTree(-1, "fast")` on a tree it
opened) and copies through an XRootD proxy or a FUSE mount with uCache inside
it. Make those copies with the cache switched off: `UCACHE_DISABLE=1 …`. The same holds for
inspecting a file's real form from your own session: `TTree::Print`,
`TFile::Map` or the `RNTupleInspector` report the sizes and codecs of the layout
they are shown. Each handle recognised as a copy is counted in
`copier_handles` (`ucache stats`); `copy_detect = off` turns the recognition
off.

**Jobs that read most of every file are read, not cached.** uCache is built for
analyses that read part of each file, again and again. A job that reads most
of every file — a skim that writes out nearly every branch, a format
conversion — would fill the cache with the whole dataset and push out what
your analyses use, for little gain; if you have the space for the whole
dataset, a local copy serves such a job better. So when a job's reads of a ROOT
file (a TTree or RNTuple of 64 MiB or more) cover branches holding more than
`max_read_fraction` of the file's data (default 25%), the job reads that file
straight from the origin:

- what it fetches for the file's data is not kept. Bytes already in the cache
  are still served, and the file's own records (header, keys list, tree
  metadata) are cached as usual;
- the decision is taken once per file per job, early — as soon as the branches
  read so far hold more than the limit, or once the job comes back to branches
  it has already read — and is not revisited;
- one warning per job names the first such file. `ucache stats` counts them
  (`direct_read_files`, `direct_read_bytes`), and their bytes show as direct,
  like pass-through.

To cache such a job anyway — decompression is what slows it and a replica
would help, or you want its second pass warm — raise the limit for that job,
`UCACHE_MAX_READ_FRACTION=100 ./my_job`, or for every job with
`ucache set max_read_fraction 100`. Files under 64 MiB, and files that are not
a TTree or RNTuple, are always cached.

**Eviction is on by default.** With no `max_bytes` set, the cache uses the disk
freely and evicts least-recently-used entries only to keep a free-space floor
(`min(50 GiB, 10% of the volume)` free) — so a heavy session fills most of the
disk and reclaims under pressure. Set `max_bytes` for a fixed-size cache instead.
Protect a hot dataset from eviction with `ucache pin <url>`. To reclaim space
yourself — by age, by size, per file, or all at once — see the cleanup commands
below and the dedicated guide in `docs/CACHE_MANAGEMENT.md`.

## CLI reference

| command            | what it does |
|--------------------|--------------|
| `ucache --version` (`-V`) | print the version and the build id, then exit. The build id identifies the revision this binary was built from (`v0.18.3`, or `v0.18.3-4-g1a2b3c-dirty` for a local build with edits); it also appears in every benchmark record, so a measurement can be traced back to a binary. A build id equal to the bare version means the build could not read its own revision |
| `ucache setup [--host H] [--dir PATH]` | write the single conf file (activation + settings, cache dir explicit) to `~/.xrootd/client.plugins.d` |
| `ucache doctor`    | check install, filesystem (sparse/flock), and activation |
| `ucache test <url>` | end-to-end self-test: cold + warm whole-file read via xrdcp against your setup as-is (its copies run with copy detection and recompression off and `max_read_fraction` at 100, so they exercise the byte cache); warm must be origin-free; cleans up the entry it created (pre-existing entries kept) |
| `ucache enable` / `disable` | turn caching on/off (flips the conf) |
| `ucache summary [--detail] [--json]` | **overall performance across every recorded run, and the time the cache has saved (or cost) you, measured against a no-cache baseline** — record one by running your job once with `UCACHE_DISABLE=1`. Refused with a reason rather than qualified when the comparison would not be sound. `--detail` adds the last run: tier split, delivered rate, per-tier read counts and sizes, replica coverage |
| `ucache history [--top N] [--json]` | an **ALL** row aggregating every recorded run, then one row per run, newest first — whether the numbers are holding up across runs, versions and machines |
| `ucache status`    | cache location, budget, usage, aggregate stats |
| `ucache ls [--sort age\|size]` | list cached entries (size, cached, coverage, last-used age, replica, pinned) |
| `ucache stats`     | aggregate `stats/*.jsonl` across all processes, plus the derived **workflow picture**: opens per distinct file, bytes served per tier (direct / fill / RAM / disk / replica), disk-read count + mean size + sequential share, re-read factor, fill flush shape, and p50/p95/p99 latencies |
| `ucache stats --files [--top N]` | per-file records (one per file per process), costliest first: which files were re-opened, re-read, served from which tier |
| `ucache stats --reset` | start a fresh counter window for measuring **one** run against a specific cache state (run it between jobs — it warns if a file looks live). The counter and per-file records MOVE to `stats/history`, where `summary` and `history` keep reading them: deleting them would delete any measured no-cache baseline, which is the one thing later runs are compared against. Traces are deleted (bulky, per-op, no run-level meaning). The cache contents are untouched |
| `ucache bench --threads N [PATH …] [--size SZ] [--measurement-duration S] [--block KB] [--fill writers=N,block=SZ] [--sweep] [--cache-path [--cache-sample SZ]] [--log FILE\|--no-log]` | storage self-test of the cache dir (or of candidate dirs, to pick one). Three groups: **standard** measures at pinned block sizes and queue depths 1/16/32, comparable to a datasheet; **pattern** measures at your job's concurrency — each serving tier's read shape, and random reads under writeback; and, with `--cache-path`, the same storage **through uCache's own fill and read code** rather than an imitation of it. Plus fsync, create/unlink. `--threads` is **required and never guessed** — it is what your analyses run at, not the core count. `--measurement-duration` is the window of ONE measurement (the build stage gets 3×; the plan and estimated total print up front). Appends every run, with the machine, load and block device behind the path, to `./ucache-bench.txt`. `--publish` also sends the record — path and mount point replaced by salted hashes, hostname blanked — and prints the report URL (`docs/PUBLISH.md`). **Full guide: `docs/BENCH.md`** |
| `ucache netbench <root://…> [--streams N,…] [--block KB] [--seconds S] [--publish]` | origin random-read baseline at 1/16/64 streams: what the network side delivers, for a fair cache-vs-origin comparison. `--publish` sends the record (hostname blanked, URL reduced to its domain) for a report |
| `ucache publish [--label TEXT] [--dry-run] [--yes] [--url URL] [--runs N]` | send this cache's run history (the newest 200 runs, or `--runs N`), its disk's benchmark records (and any taken on the same volume) and this machine's origin measurements to the report service and print the report URL with its recommendations. **Paths, hostnames and file names never leave the machine** — `docs/PUBLISH.md` lists every field. `--dry-run` prints the exact payload instead; `--yes` for scripts (a non-terminal without it is refused). `bench --publish` and `netbench --publish` send one record the same way |
| `ucache identity [--set STRING \| --new \| --path]` | the identity string that groups everything you publish under one owner page: an owner id plus a salt that never leaves the machine. Created by the first publish; `--set` installs it on another machine, `--new` starts over |
| `ucache evict [--older-than DUR \| --newer-than DUR \| --to-size SIZE] [--dry-run]` | reclaim space: no flags = one pass to the configured budget; `--older-than 30d` drops entries unused that long; `--newer-than 1h` drops entries used within the window (undo a polluting run); `--to-size 20g` LRU-evicts down to a total size; `--dry-run` previews |
| `ucache rm <url> [url…]` | remove specific entries (byte cache + replica) |
| `ucache clear [--yes] [--keep-pinned] [--wait]` | empty the whole cache (prompts unless `--yes`). The cache is empty at once; the disk space is freed in the background, or before the command returns with `--wait` |
| `ucache pin <url>` / `unpin <url>` | protect / unprotect an entry from eviction |
| `ucache verify <url>` | CRC-scrub an entry; quarantine (not wipe) bad pages |
| `ucache settings`  | every setting: effective value + where it comes from (default \| conf \| state \| env) |
| `ucache set <key> <value>` / `unset <key>` | change / drop a **current** value without touching your defaults in the conf |
| `ucache recompress [--jobs N] [--yes]` | transcode the cached files whose source codec is in `recompress_codecs`, in the foreground with live progress (`--jobs` default: every core the process may use). Estimates disk growth first and asks for confirmation if the sweep would push the cache into eviction; `--yes` overrides (scripts) |
| `ucache branches <url>` | which branches your analysis read: fully-cached branches with bytes + source codec, and the summary share |
| `ucache untranspose <url>` | drop an entry's replica; the byte cache is kept |

**Recompression (decompress-once replicas).** Tightly compressed (LZMA)
ntuples spend most of a *warm* analysis just decompressing. uCache can rebuild
the branches you actually read into replicas re-encoded once as ZSTD-1 — an
order of magnitude cheaper to decode — and serve them transparently (same
results, bit-identical). One switch controls it:

```sh
ucache set recompress on   # or `recompress = on` in ucache.conf as your default
```

With it on, a file that has no replica yet gets one **on its first pass**,
TTree and RNTuple alike. uCache fetches exactly what your job asks for, as it
would anyway, converts each basket or page to ZSTD-1 as it arrives, and keeps
the converted records in the file's replica as it goes; the next run reads
them. Nothing extra is fetched and no command is needed. That first pass costs
CPU — everything it reads is converted — so on a machine short of cores it can
be slower than a pass with recompression off.

**It also costs memory, on every pass that reads such a file.** ROOT sizes its
read buffers from the layout described below and does not shrink them to fit
the memory there is, and uCache keeps a table for each such file while it is
open (about 20 MB for a large NanoAOD file). On the analyses measured (32
threads), warm passes needed about 1.8x the memory on TTree and 2.3x on RNTuple
of the same job reading a replica made by `ucache recompress` — which in turn
needs about what the job needs with no cache at all. A job that runs short of
memory is killed by the system, not warned: if yours are near their memory
limit, leave recompression off and build replicas with `ucache recompress`
instead. Turning it off later does not change files already recompressed this
way; `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` ("Jobs are killed for memory") says how to get
them back. `ucache doctor` repeats this note whenever recompression is on.

While a file is recompressed this way your jobs see it in a layout of its own,
in which every basket has room to be converted: the same data and the same
results, in a larger file. That layout is the file's for good — every process,
every open — so a job can close and reopen a file at any point, several
processes can read different parts of one file at once and build one replica
between them, and a job that ends abruptly loses at most the last few seconds
of conversion. Branches a later job reads for the first time are converted as
it reads them. Two consequences:

- A copy is still the origin's file: `xrdcp`, `xrdfs`, `xrdadler32`, XRootD's
  copy engine from any language (`gfal-copy`, `rucio download`, Python's
  `CopyProcess`), ROOT's `TFile::Cp`, `hadd` and ROOT's command-line tools are
  recognised and read straight from the origin (see "Copies are the origin's
  bytes" above). A copy made any other way — a read loop, fsspec's `get`, fast
  cloning in your own program — gets the larger layout: make it with
  `UCACHE_DISABLE=1`.
- Do not share a cache directory with uCache 1.2.0 or older. It does not know
  these replicas: it serves such files from the byte cache and the origin
  (correctly, but slowly) and can leave the replicas behind when it evicts.

**From the next pass on, a TTree file is read at its real size.** Each open is
shown the file's newest *map*: every basket converted by then stated back to
back at the size of its converted record, in an address range of the map's
own past the first-pass layout, so ROOT reads and holds just the records; the
rest stay where the first-pass layout has them. A map is made a moment after a process is
done with a file, once enough has been converted since the last one (a
twentieth of what the file's replica holds, and after the first map 8 MiB) and
nobody else is converting the file; after the first, at most one an hour. Baskets converted
after the newest map are read at the size of their room until the next one.
A handle keeps the map it was shown for its life, whatever is made after it,
and a replaced map keeps its range while any process's handle holds it and for
`in_use_seconds` (1 day) after it was last used, for readers still holding its
positions. After that a read in its range fails, with an error that says so:
reopening the file shows the current map. At most four maps are in use at once;
when a fifth would be due, new opens are shown the first-pass layout, which
states everything converted (`ucache stats` counts it). `mixed_maps = off` shows every open
the plain layout: use it when a job hands basket positions to workers on
other machines, each with a cache of its own (`uproot.dask` with remote
workers). RNTuple files are always shown the plain layout. The memory figures
above were measured before maps existed; for TTree they are expected to come
down, and have not been measured again yet.

Only branches whose source codec is in `recompress_codecs` (default
`lzma,zlib`) are converted; recompressing already-fast codecs would waste CPU
and disk. Everything else — other codecs, the file's own records, and the rare
basket whose converted form does not fit — is kept in the byte cache as usual.
What was converted is not ALSO kept in the byte cache, and a copy the byte cache
held from before is released once its basket is converted; set
`recompress_keep_originals = on` if you want both, for instance to compare the
two tiers on one cache. Converted records are held to the cache's limits like
any other cached data, so keeping them can evict least-recently-used entries.
What still does not fit above the free-space floor is not kept (a later read
converts it again), and `ucache stats` counts it as not kept.

`recompress = off` only stops files that have no replica from getting one. A
file that has one keeps being served from it, and what a job reads of it for
the first time is still converted.

A file the first pass cannot recompress is served from the byte cache. The
plugin warns about the first such file of each process, naming the reason;
`ucache stats` counts them as `cold_replica_skipped`, and `ucache status` on
its `declined` line. The commonest reason is the codec: a file stored in a
codec that is not in `recompress_codecs` is left as it is, and changing the
list makes the next read decide again. A file whose compression setting names
no codec (setting 1, "the global default", from older ROOT versions or
`hadd -f1`) is judged by the codec its baskets are actually stored in. For
other reasons (an unusual structure), the warning says so, and an explicit
`ucache recompress` may still build a replica.

`ucache recompress` runs one foreground sweep, with live progress, over what is
already in the byte cache: you need it only for data cached before
recompression was switched on and never read since, and for files the first
pass declined. Check where you stand with `ucache status` (the `recompressed:`
line) or per file with `ucache ls` (the `RECOMP` column). The sweep's own
summary gives each outcome its own words —
`recompressed`, `declined` (with the codec it found and the one-line fix),
`already recompressed`, `incomplete`, `failed`, and `deferred (no space)` for
files that would not fit above the free-space floor (run it again once there
is room).
`ucache doctor` will tell you why nothing is being built if that is what you are
seeing (see Troubleshooting).

Replicas coexist with the byte cache by default (only the ranges the replica
physically replaced are punched). If disk space is tight, make replicas the
primary copy instead:

```sh
ucache set recompress_reclaim full
ucache recompress            # also retroactively reclaims existing replicas
```

Every entry with a valid replica then gives back its whole byte-cache copy the
moment the replica is available; anything the replica does not cover refetches
from the origin on demand. See CACHE_MANAGEMENT §4 for details.

Set expectations honestly: the replica removes *decompression* time only. A
warm analysis that is 80% LZMA decode gets several× faster; one dominated by
its own compute may gain 10%. One instrumented run with ROOT's
`TTreePerfStats` tells you your ceiling before you spend the disk (measured
1.04–1.22× of the cached bytes on LZMA-9 sources, by container — see
`docs/CACHE_MANAGEMENT.md` §3; `ucache status` totals it, and superseded
original pages are hole-punched so the data is not stored twice). `ucache
branches <url>` shows exactly which branches you read and their codecs.
Escape hatches: `ucache set transpose off` stops serving replicas; `ucache
untranspose <url>` drops one (a replica made on a first pass is rebuilt from the
origin the next time the file is read).

Stuck? See **`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`**.
