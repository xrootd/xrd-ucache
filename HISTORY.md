Changelog — what each release changed, newest first. High level only: the
things that affect someone using uCache; the commit history has the detail.
Heading size is how much the release matters: `#` a landmark, `##` new
capability, `###` fixes and refinements.

Versions are SemVer: `x` changes something you depend on, `y` adds capability,
`z` fixes and refines. Prebuilt EL9 packages are attached to each release.

**Across every release:** a newer release reads a cache written by an older one.
Recompression stays off unless you turn it on. Nothing is published unless you
run `ucache publish`. Any XRootD 5.6 or newer 5.x client works; 6.x from
v0.21.0.

## v1.4.0 — 2026-10-05
- Recompressing files as they are first read (`recompress = on`) now makes
  later reads as fast as recompressing them with `ucache recompress`, with
  less memory than in 1.3; the first read takes close to what it takes with
  the cache off, for RNTuple as for TTree.
- Replicas built by `ucache recompress` in earlier releases are not used;
  running it again rebuilds them from what is cached.
- `in_use_seconds` replaces `evict_protect_seconds` and `map_expiry_seconds`;
  `recompress_reclaim` is gone.

### v1.3.5 — 2026-09-30
- On macOS, cached data takes no more disk space than its size. A cache
  made by an earlier version is only fixed once you clear it (`ucache clear`);
  `ucache doctor` tells you whether yours needs it.
- `ucache clear` empties the cache at once and frees its disk space in the
  background; `--wait` waits for it.
- `ucache status` shows the disk space the cache takes, as `du` does.

### v1.3.4 — 2026-09-29
- The macOS tarball, which 1.3.3 lacks; otherwise the same as 1.3.3.

### v1.3.3 — 2026-09-29
- `XRD_LOGLEVEL=Debug` shows uCache's messages in the client's log; a log
  with a warning starts with a line naming the version and cache directory.
- Bug fixes:
  - Jobs reading one file with many threads no longer report CRC
    mismatches; caches that show them heal after the upgrade.
  - With `recompress = on`, a damaged cached page no longer stops the job.

### v1.3.2 — 2026-09-29
- `ucache publish` sends more about each run, so reports can compare jobs
  and machines.
- Instruction counts are recorded on macOS and are correct on shared
  machines.
- Bug fixes:
  - `recompress = on` works on the 2015 CMS open data.
  - uCache warns when a file cannot be recompressed on its first read.

### v1.3.1 — 2026-09-27
- `ucache summary` and `ucache history` show the gain after a first run over
  an empty cache and a second run; a separate run with the cache off is no
  longer needed.
- `ucache recompress` uses all cores by default (`--jobs N` to use fewer).
- Bug fixes:
  - Python process pools (`multiprocessing`, `concurrent.futures`) work with
    uCache.
  - Copying a recompressed file with fsspec or your own script gives the
    original file, or an error telling you to copy with the cache off.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-09-26
- With `recompress = on`, a file's replica is built while it is first read; no
  separate `ucache recompress` pass is needed.
- Copies — `xrdcp`, `hadd`, `rootcp`, gfal, ROOT's `TFile::Cp` and similar —
  read straight from the origin and leave the cache unchanged.
- Added `max_read_fraction`: a job that reads most of a large file reads it
  from the origin instead of caching it; default 25%.
- Prebuilt binaries for macOS on Apple silicon: one tarball that uses the
  XRootD client of the ROOT or XRootD you already have.
- The package includes `ucache_demo.C`: a dimuon mass analysis over 100 CMS
  open-data files that shows the cache working, cold and warm, through the
  byte cache and the replicas.
- One package serves XRootD 5 and 6 clients: it carries a build of the plugin
  for each, and the client loads its own.
- The RPM no longer requires the XRootD client; uCache uses whichever client
  the process has loaded.
- `XRD_PLUGIN=<dir>/libXrdClUCache.so` with `UCACHE_DIR` turns uCache on with
  every default and no config file.
- The RPM installs a recommended configuration at
  `/usr/share/xrd-ucache/ucache.conf`.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-09-22
- Added `prefetch`: read-ahead for TTree reads, so a first pass waits less on
  the origin; off by default, on with `prefetch = on`.

### v1.1.1 — 2026-09-16
- Multi-process readers such as coffea now fill the cache and appear in
  `ucache summary` and `ucache history` the same way a single process does.
- uproot 5 with its default transport reads cached files.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-09-07
- Added `ucache publish`: submit benchmark records and run history for
  analysis and recommendations; data is anonymized.
- Added `ucache identity`: view or set the identity used to link
  published records across machines and browsers.
- Added `announce`: uCache identifies itself to XRootD servers so sites can see
  traffic that comes through a cache; on by default, off with `announce = off`.

# v1.0.0 — 2026-09-02
- Changed cache data format to support cache gain monitoring.
- Added `ucache summary`: total and latest-run time savings.
- Added `ucache history`: per-run duration, bytes read, cache tier, and measured gain.
- `ucache stats --reset` now archives records instead of deleting them, preserving gain baselines.

## v0.21.0 — 2026-08-21
- XRootD 6 clients are supported — the plugin builds against and loads into 6 as
  well as 5.
- A running job no longer evicts its own working set: an entry is not an eviction
  candidate while it was read within the last day.
- When the cache is full of such entries it stops caching new files rather than
  evicting data the job still needs, and `ucache status` says so. Reads keep
  working, uncached. `evict_protect_seconds = 0` restores the old behaviour.
- Recompression accepts ZLIB sources by default as well as LZMA, so it no longer
  declines a ZLIB dataset without being told to.

## v0.20.0 — 2026-08-16
- The plugin, the CLI and the tests build and run on macOS (Apple silicon,
  MacPorts), and uCache serves `root://` reads there.
- `ucache bench` measures macOS storage too, and reports how that measurement
  differs from the Linux one — the two platforms cannot bypass the page cache
  the same way.
- Faster checksums on 64-bit Arm.
- Building against XRootD 6 stops at configure with an explanation, rather than
  failing deep inside the compiler.

### v0.19.1 — 2026-08-13
- A warm pass over a recompressed RNTuple file no longer re-reads anything from
  the origin.

## v0.19.0 — 2026-08-13
- RNTuple files can be recompressed into the replica tier — same switch, same
  behaviour as TTree files.
- Large reads are cached again: their edge pages were being dropped, and an
  oversized vector-read element was refused outright.

### v0.18.4 — 2026-08-12
- `ucache bench` measures a cold fill through uCache's own code rather than an
  imitation of it.
- A reference describing every measurement `ucache bench` makes, and how to
  read it.

### v0.18.3 — 2026-08-10
- `ucache bench` records the device it measured and attributes the run's IO to
  it, so a number can be traced to the hardware that produced it.

### v0.18.2 — 2026-08-10
- `ucache bench` measures at several stream counts, split into
  datasheet-comparable and workload-shaped groups, with every run appended to a
  log.
- `--threads` is required rather than guessed: it is the concurrency your jobs
  actually run at, which no tool can infer.

### v0.18.1 — 2026-07-27
- A failed recompression build is reported and exits non-zero; `--strict` for
  callers who want it enforced.
- The number of background recompression jobs is set by the caller.

## v0.18.0 — 2026-07-27
- Reads of cached data issue one request per contiguous run of pages instead of
  one per page, on both cache tiers.

### v0.17.5 — 2026-07-26
- Background recompression respects the eviction floor, so it can no longer
  fill the cache and start evicting the data your job is reading.
- When it builds nothing, it says which reason applies.
- Pages are verified against their checksums before being recompressed.

### v0.17.4 — 2026-07-25
- ROOT files that grew past 2 GB after their key list was written can be
  recompressed; earlier releases refused them.

### v0.17.3 — 2026-07-22
- Prebuilt EL9 packages (RPM and relocatable tarball) attached to each release,
  built against the oldest supported client so they load under any newer one.
- `ucache doctor` detects an XRootD client too old for the plugin; previously
  it simply did not load, and nothing said why.

# v0.17.2 — 2026-07-22
- First public release: a transparent per-user read cache for `root://` data —
  an XrdCl plugin that caches the pages your jobs read onto local disk, and a
  `ucache` command to set it up, inspect it and clean it.
- Fail-open by construction: any cache problem degrades to a normal uncached
  read.
- Optional recompression rewrites cached files into a form that is faster to
  read back.
